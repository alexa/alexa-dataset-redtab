If you ever see stink lines coming at you, run the other way, man.", "Darrow2 - #47 With the show wrapping up, the Runaway Five throw caution to the wind and...drive straight through the wall. Take that, manager lady! ...But seriously, kids, don't drive through walls unless you're drunk and have no control, or have some form of OCD that forces you to drive through several walls per day.
