Amacher left Kane to attend the University of Pennsylvania where she received a B.F.A in 1964. Subsequently, she did graduate work in acoustics and computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\u00a0 While there she studied composition with George Rochberg and Karlheinz Stockhausen., 127594=Copyright \u00a9 2012 KBOO Community Radio | Copyright Policy | Community Guidelines | Website Illustration & Design by: KMF ILLUSTRATION, 44446=Her major pieces have almost exclusively been site specific, often using many loudspeakers to create what she called \"structure borne sound\", which is a differentiation with \"airborne sound\", the paradox intentional. By using many diffuse sound sources (either not in the space or speakers facing at the walls or floors) she would create the psychoacoustic illusions of sound shapes/\"precense\". Amacher's early work is best represented in the three series of multimedia installations produced in the United States, Europe, and Japan: the sonic telepresence series, \"CITY LINKS\" 1-22 (1967- ); the architecturally staged \"MUSIC FOR SOUND JOINED ROOMS\" (1980- ) and the \"MINI-SOUND SERIES\" (1985- ) a new multimedia form which she created, that is unique in its use of architecture and serialized narrative., 35480=Xerophonics - Matrix 12510-12 - from Xerophonics - 4:15 David Slusser - Creaks - from Delight at the End of The Tunnel - 0:59 \u00a0here's a closer look at this work, Slusser's first album on Tzadik: http://www.furious.com/perfect/slusser.html and here is an article about Slusser's amazing life (where your eyebrow will likely raise at least once per paragraph): http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-08-17/music/17255450_1_saudi-princess-ro... Stomp - Waterphonics - from Orbitones, Spoon Harps and Bellowphones - 2:20 Raymond Scott - Backward Beeps - from Manhattan Research Inc - 1:05 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 performed on Scott's \"Circle Machine\" - Around 1959, Scott designed and built the Circle Machine, a more compact electronic sequencer. Dr. Thomas Rhea, music synthesis professor at the Berklee College of Music, visited Scott many times in the early '70s and remembers the Circle Machine as \"an analog waveform generator that was this crazy, whirling-dervish thing. It had a ring of incandescent lamps, each with its own rheostat, and a photo-electric cell on a spindle that twirled in a circle above the lights.\" Each bulb's intensity was individually adjustable, as was the rotation speed of the photocell. As the lights brightened, the pitch ascended. Arm rotation speed governed the rhythm. The lights could be stag-gered in brightness, and depending on the pattern, the tone sequence generated would change. The Circle Machine was capable of a wide range of unearthly sounds, as heard in numerous commercial jingles Scott recorded during the late 1950s and early 1960s (many of them are included on Manhattan Research Inc.).\u00a0 SPIN: ''Paranoiac, visionary, misanthrope, and machine fetishist, the late composer Raymond Scott was also an electronic music pioneer and inventor geek who had Madison Avenue paying him to soundtrack its vision of postwar American futurism. The music on MANHATTAN RESEARCH INC. is both archaic and tres moderne. It reveals the fears and fantasies of a nation in boom-time denial. And Scott mischievously spikes almost every one with a dystopian mickey: could give a kid nightmares for years.''

The orchestra is \u2018conducted\u2019 by a network server which reads from a composed \u2018score\u2019. Each of the printers plays from a different \u2018part\u2019 comprised of rhythms and pitches made up of letters of the alphabet, punctuation marks and other characters. [The User] uses ASCII textfiles to compose, orchestrate, and synchronize sonorous and densely textured, rhythmically-driven music. \u00a0Hans Reichel - For Those Who love Propellers - from Lower Lurum - 2:56 Hans Reichel's Lower Lurum is perhaps the record that introduced the world to his invention, the daxophone, a box playing a long, thin altered board that produces so many tones and sounds they are virtually limitless. Add to this Reichel's homemade guitars, which are truly exotic pieces of art as well as functional instruments, and you have an orchestra from another dimension. Which is what Lower Lurum is pretty much all about. Being subtitled as a \"guitar and daxophone\" operetta, in Reichel's mind there is probably a concept here. But that concept for the listener -- especially since there are no notes explaining what the \"plot\" of this operetta is supposed to be -- is tonal. Given how technical Reichel is about everything in the booklet, it is -- for those who've never heard Reichel's music -- shocking to hear its emotional warmth, depth, and humor. There is very little manipulation of sound with overdubs occurring in very few places, and even they are used sparingly. This is music that comes straight through the microphone without effects. In large part this is because it doesn't need any. Reichel's operetta and his music in general are more musical than music because they integrate the entire human being -- physical, psychological, emotional, spiritual -- into the way in which a composition or improvisation is executed and ultimately sounds. On Lower Lurum, Reichel has created a light body (or, from the Buddhist perspective, a rainbow body) of sound. Its clarity and spirit are one in the same, expressed as resonances from the heart through the hands and moving beyond them both into a sonic architecture that expresses emotions and thoughts that occur just beyond the field of language, and that achievement is far greater that the faculty of language this reviewer possesses. ~ Thom Jurek, All Music Guide <announce> Maryanne Amacher - Synaptic Island - from Sound Characters - 8:36, 43707=While in residence at the University of Buffalo, in 1967, she created City Links: Buffalo, a 28-hour piece using 5 microphones in different parts of the city, broadcast live by radio station WBFO. There were several other pieces in the \"City Links\" series, though many details are not yet known. A common feature was the use of telephone lines to connect the sound environments of different sites into the same space, a very early example of what is now called \"telematic performance\" and preceded much more famous examples of this by Max Neuhaus and others.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:54:32 +0000", "textBeforeTable": "06/30/2010 Air date:\u00a0 A Jazz World Program name:\u00a0 Jazz Categories: A Jazz World playlist for 06/30/2010 view full schedule All Black Everything 3:00am-5:30am The Sacred Circle \"TEMENOS\" Mobile Support Archives Listen Schedule Programs \u00a0", "textAfterTable": "Program name:\u00a0 Jazz Lives!
