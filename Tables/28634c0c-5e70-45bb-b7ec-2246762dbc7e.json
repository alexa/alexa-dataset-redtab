What the film does have going for it is the setting, with Blue Lagoon, Vittoriosa and Mdina all featuring prominently as the stunning backdrop to the mismatched couple\u2019s shipwrecked shenanigans., 955=Malta\u2019s summer season - stretching from April right through to October - is the best time to visit, with daytime temperatures generally sitting in the high 20s that are tempered by sea breezes along the coast.
