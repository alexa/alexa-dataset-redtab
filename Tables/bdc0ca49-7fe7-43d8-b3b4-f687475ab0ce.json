He also puts emphasis on texture to give subjects character. His work within the TCG is similar but subtler, instead using highlights and contrasting colors to make Pok\u00e9mon stand out. For a list of cards he has illustrated, go here. In addition to card illustrations, Saito provided the packaging art for the Garchomp and Hydreigon Half Decks, and the box art for Everyone's Exciting Battle. He also illustrated the Pok\u00e9mon Tales book Crustle's Moving, available to read on the Pok\u00e9mon Daisuki Club website.
