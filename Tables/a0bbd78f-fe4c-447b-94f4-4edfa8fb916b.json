A special show tonight as we aired part 2 of the 5th annual \"Around the World in 20+ Dubs\" (originally aired 4/29 on Echo Beach at WLUW-FM, Chicago). But, before the ATW 20+ special mix, we started things off with Taj Weekes & Adowa in advance of their upcoming MPLS show (6/14 - 7th St Entry) & their upcoming appearance at the Bayfront Reggae Festival (7/17 - Duluth,MN). Followed up with Nkulee Dube, who will also be at the Bayfront Fest (7/16) from her new album \"My Way\". Also new vibes tonight from The Technician (from the new album \"Earth Shaker vol. 2\"), Gen.
