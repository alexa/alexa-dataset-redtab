Kane's most accessible songs. No \"Supervixens\" or \"Down\" here, but two versions of \"Crack Up,\" along with other generally dance-friendly numbers like \"Miles Apart\" and \"Love from Outer Space,\" do surface. The duo themselves remix three of the tracks, while longtime collaborator/producer Robin Guthrie does the honors with the rest. Generally, the remixes make everything a little more lighter and uncluttered - the temptation is to say everything was aimed at a radio audience, yet this being A.R. Kane, even at their most direct things can never be quite so broadcast-ready! Still, \"Miles Apart\" has much more of a sharp feel to it this out, while \"Sugarwings\" \u2014 already a gentle strum of a soul weeper on \"i\" \u2014 becomes yet more gentle and relaxed as a result. Fun if you find it, but you need to find \"i\" a lot more quickly!
