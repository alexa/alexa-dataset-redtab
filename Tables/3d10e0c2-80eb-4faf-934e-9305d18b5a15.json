The production is perfectly timeless yet relevant and stands up to the mainstream music we hear everyday. Colin's songwriting is beautiful and poetic, and his voice is so good its is NOT normal, and on top of all that, it just feels so good to hear a group of musicians playing music together and creating something organic and passionate. I can only think that this is what music is supposed to be like. Well done! One of those voices you never forget... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by JenVegas I recall the first tme I heard Colin's voice, via a myspace page for (mr. north). Wow. His voice is as real as they come. I've always known Colin to be great at what he does, but he blew me away with this album.
