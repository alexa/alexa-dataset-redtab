The songs from Briefcase Full of Blues are the highlights; tracks like \"Messin' With the Kid,\" \"Rubber Biscuit,\" and the huge hit \"Soul Man\" are loose, full of fun, and alive with soul \u2014 they capture a cultural moment and will have you dancing around the room.

By the time Made in America was released, the Blues Brothers' schtick was wearing a bit thin (Elwood sounds especially dorky on his molasses-slow rendition of the Robins/Coasters' \"Riot in Cell Block #9\"), the music was sounding a bit tired and overly professional, and the covers less obscure. There is enough energy in the presentation to make the music fun, but it doesn't have the same punch that the first record did. An essential Blues Brothers release would probably have more songs from the first record, less from the second, and a couple more tracks from the soundtrack, like the funky \"She Caught the Katy.\" You might as well choose The Definitive Collection. It sells for about the same price but has 20 songs instead of 12, including seven from Briefcase; takes more songs from the movie, including Aretha Franklin's storming version of \"Think\" (but not \"She Caught the Katy\" for some reason); and has a weird version of \"Expressway to Your Heart\" unavailable elsewhere., 125967=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc. \u039c\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2., 25523=Formed: 1976 in New York, NY}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 03:38:27 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Open iTunes to preview, buy and download music.
