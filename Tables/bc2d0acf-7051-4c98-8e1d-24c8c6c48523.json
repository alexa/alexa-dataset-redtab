It's coming up from the floor of my planters along my brick exterior, and it's mixed in and similar to my Virginia creeper (even more suspicious). I'm in rural Fla panhandle along a state forest. Someone has mentioned blackberry... could a blackberry look so much like poison ivy that more than one outdoor person could be mistaken when they tell me 'sure does look like (poison ivy)' ?
