She didn't even win Idol!!! Even though this may be a small single, it holds Jessica's endless talent, and is a brilliant taste of Jessica's soon-to-be Solo Album to be released either in the last quarter of 2008, or early quarter of 2009. Featuring Flo Rida, this single is truly one of the best debut singles this industry has ever heard in a long time!, 103774=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
