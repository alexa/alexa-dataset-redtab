It seems Kentwood has been struggling the last 2 years. Can someone tell us what is going on under the water tower down there, and what to expect out of this years Kangaroo team? How did they pull out the win against Southern Lab last Friday? What can we look for in thier offense, and how big and fast is thier defense this year?
