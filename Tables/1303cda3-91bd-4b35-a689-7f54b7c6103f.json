Featuring their trademark hardcore techno sound, this four-disc Whatever You Want edition features its 14 original tracks, including cover versions of OMD's \"Enola Gay,\" Giorgio Moroder's theme to \"Never Ending Story,\" and Kim Wilde's \"Cambodia,\" plus a remix of \"Jump That Rock,\" featuring Status Quo. Also included are 26 of their greatest hits, some of which didn't feature on their previous 24 Carat compilation, and two bonus DVDs packed full of live performances and promotional videos. ~ Jon O'Brien, Rovi Biography Formed: Hamburg, Germany Genre: Dance Years Active: '90s, '00s, '10s German techno group Scooter was formed in 1994 by H.P.
