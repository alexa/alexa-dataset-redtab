We always use \"yellow\" potatoes here in Per\u00fa, wich are the most floury ones and therefore will make the best mashed potatoes. Now you add lemon juice. Lets say for one cup mashed yellow potatoes you will need 1 lemon. Please note that in southamerica our lemons are the most sour ones one will find. I've heard that one will NOT find lemons like the ones we have here somwhere else in the world, so try to get the smallest, greenest and souer-est of all! And to finish the potato paste you need to add \"Aj\u00ed Amarillo\", Yellow.. hmmm... spicy chilly pepper. Here I found some info. about it: http://www.canelaycomino.com/2008/02/diy-aji-amarillo-paste/}", "lastModified": "Thu, 30 Jul 2015 04:08:03 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "New forum activity since your last visit More information about formatting options Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.
