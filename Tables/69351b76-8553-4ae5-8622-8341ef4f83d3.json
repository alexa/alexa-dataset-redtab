Opener \u201cNeedle\u201d uses the same idiom as Elliott Smith\u2019s \u201cNeedle in the Hay\u201d but couldn\u2019t be further from that harrowing song, despite lyrics like \u201cI belong to no one \u2026 like a song without an album\u201d; the song\u2019s desperation is delivered with a smile and a wink over a stuttering indie funk. \u201cOcean\u2019s Deep\u201d swings with nautical swagger, like Phoenix in boat shoes, with a driving bassline sending its soaring chorus home, while \u201cPermanent Hesitation\u201d sees the band incorporating some percolating synths into its sound concoction, while singer Luke Lalonde implores the object of his wandering eye, \u201cIs it cheating if I call you sweetheart?\u201d Born Ruffians\u2019 references are sometimes too well-worn to shine, but their energy and amiability go a long way, as does their up-for-anything attitude. Even against your own will, Birthmarks will have you shaking and singing. 04/15/2013 Amoeba Review WAV $14.98 M4A $12.48 MP3 $9.98", "textAfterTable": "MP3 $9.98 M4A $12.48 WAV $14.98 User Reviews Overall Rating 0 Submissions RATE & REVIEW Who We Are Amoeblog Buy Sell Trade News & Contests Gift Certificates Contact Us Support & FAQ Sign-up", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
