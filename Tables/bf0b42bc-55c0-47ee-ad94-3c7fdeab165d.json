A few other singles became posthumous hits, and a good amount of other unreleased material was issued in the wake of his death. These releases weren't purely exploitative in nature, in fact containing some pretty interesting music, and little that could be considered embarrassing. What Redding might have achieved, or what directions he might have explored, are among the countless tantalizing \"what if\" questions in rock & roll history. As it is, he did record a considerable wealth of music at Stax, which is now available on thoughtfully archived reissues., 37342=Although Redding at his peak was viewed as a consummate, versatile showman, he began his recording career in the early '60s as a Little Richard-styled shouter. The Georgian was working in the band of guitarist Johnny Jenkins at the time, and in 1962 he took advantage of an opportunity to record the ballad \"These Arms of Mine\" at a Jenkins session. When it became an R&B hit, Redding's solo career was truly on its way, though the hits didn't really start to fly until 1965 and 1966, when \"Mr. Pitiful,\" \"I've Been Loving You Too Long,\" \"I Can't Turn You Loose,\" a cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Satisfaction,\" and \"Respect\" (later turned into a huge pop smash by Aretha Franklin) were all big sellers., 36004=One of Redding's biggest hits was a duet with fellow Stax star Carla Thomas, \"Tramp,\" in 1967. That was the same year he began to show signs of making major inroads into the white audience, particularly with a well-received performance at the Monterey Pop Festival (also issued on record). Redding's biggest triumph, however, came just days before his death, when he recorded the wistful \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" which represented a significant leap as far as examination of more intensely personal emotions. Also highlighted by crisp Cropper guitar leads and dignified horns, it rose to the top of the pop charts in early 1968.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70423=9\u00a0septembre\u00a01941 \u00e0 Dawson, GA, 80988=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
