All rights reserved., 17809=Formed: 1978 in London, England, 16008=Like other have said, why does iTunes list this as 1978 when it should be 1985 (initial release)??? I was only a cursory PIL listener before this album came out and I was astounded when it did. It's surprisingly 'catchy' compared to earlier PIL, yet still not quite mainstream. I loved the album concept too (\"LP\"/\"Cassette\"...and later \"Compact Disc\"), which I understand John Lydon was trying too irritate the record company at the time...AND make fun of popular music as PRODUCT, not ART. He may not often be the voice of reason, but there's often reason behind his thinking, even if you don't see it. I never really cared about The Sex Pistols, but something about PIL really intrigued me...and when I saw John(ny) being interviewed a few times, I saw a truly interesting person there, though I have to admit I still don't know how so, but he's no idiot.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 08:23:55 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "View In iTunes The Flowers of Romance 5.
