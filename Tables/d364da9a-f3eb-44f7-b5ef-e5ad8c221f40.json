This episode of listening pleasures is definitely an ode to our love of hip hop, grime, heavy beats, warm bass, and a nostalgic backdrop that\u2019s a perfect soundtrack to the remainder of this beautiful summer. And with some wonderfully bucolic and nostalgic beats from The Bear & The Sea, A Gap Between, and Masm\u00f6d, along with some beautiful gems from Datahowler, Galapagoose, Big Spider\u2019s Back, and a plethora of others, you\u2019re sure to enjoy the hell outta this episode. So cue up your stereo, and bump some Listening Pleasures from here to the coast.
