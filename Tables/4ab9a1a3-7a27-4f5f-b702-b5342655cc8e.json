Mesoamericans occupied the area early on, with archaeological evidence pointing towards Mesoamericans leading a hunter-gatherer existence. Maize farming is thought to have become commonplace by 1500 BC, which led to the farming of other commodities as well. A variety of cultures contributed to the early history of Mexico, with the Olmec, Toltec, Maya, Teotihuacan and Aztecs all bringing unique cultural, religious and artistic styles to the region, with the Mayan and Aztec Empires having the greatest (and most enduring) impact on the region. Mayan society can be traced back to 300 BC, while the Aztecs enjoyed prosperity from 1325 to around 1521 AD. Many ancient ruins and constructions from these periods are still standing all throughout Mexico, and can be visited and viewed today. By the 16th century, the Spanish had arrived in Mexico and what followed was a period of colonialism that lasted nearly 300 years. During this time, Mexico was seen as a part of \u2018New Spain\u2019 along with Cuba and Puerto Rico. This was not a particularly good time for Mexicans who (under colonial law) were generally not allowed to travel outside of Mexico and were denied access to education. Mexico achieved independence from the Spaniards after the War of Independence (1810-1821) but peace was short lived as two decades later the Mexican-American War brought more confrontation and armed conflict to parts of Mexico., 98748=Mexico\u2019s Revolution of 1910 - 1921 was a period of instability, marked by political turmoil and bloodshed. More recently, Mexico has enjoyed an economic resurgence after decades of economic hardship, which lasted from the 1970s to the mid 1990s. The earthquake of 1985 didn\u2019t help matters, with wide-scale damage and loss of life compounding the economic problems and political uncertainty of Mexico. Currently, Mexico is benefiting from a period of improved economic conditions, although the gap between the wages earned by Mexicans and their northern neighbours continues to widen. Mexico is now operating in a free market economy and the growth of tourism, agriculture and industry has ensured an improved economy for the country, although financial inequality still exists within., 89121=Mexico is generally most pleasant in the cool, dry season between September and June. July and August can be very hot and humid, but perfect for swimming, snorkelling and lazing on the beach. It is, however, the busiest months for travel as this is the time of the North American school holidays. Highland areas such as Chiapas and Oaxaca tend to be cooler year round, with cold nights.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading 9.
