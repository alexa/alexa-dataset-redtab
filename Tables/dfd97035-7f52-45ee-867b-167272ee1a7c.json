Zenamon, among others. They open the door on a world that extends far beyond the beaches and Carnivals of Rio and Salvador, and do it in a most adventurous fashion, since a lineup of three cellos together doesn't fit as standard in anyone's book. However, the beautiful arrangements and exquisite playing bring out rare qualities in the music; there's a moment during Miranda's \"Reflexos\" where the cellos seem to imitate a steel guitar, while in Villa-Lobos' \"Trenzinho Caipira\" one of the instruments seems to play notes impossibly high for a cello. The dark, woody tones offer plenty of shade to the melodies, whether it's the slithering grace of Nazareth's tangos or the Bach-ian counterpoint of Zenamon's \"Entre\u00e9.\" The composers here stand with the best out of Europe, illustrating that Brazil has much to offer that remains largely undiscovered outside the country. A small gem and a triumph of a disc.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
