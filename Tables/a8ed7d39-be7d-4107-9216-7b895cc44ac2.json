It offers a similar \"marching\" pace and riff to the aforementioned song. McClain's drumming in this song stands out. However, the Ignite cover, \"Our Darkest Days/Bleeding\", is an amazing Melodic Hardcore song that offers a pretty summary of Machine Head's discography, except the two Nu Metal albums. The band's performance is very top-notch, with heart-felt vocal performances from Mr. Flynn. At least metal is not dead \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Machineheadrises This is the only band doing what metallica, slayer and pantera started. This is another great song by them.
