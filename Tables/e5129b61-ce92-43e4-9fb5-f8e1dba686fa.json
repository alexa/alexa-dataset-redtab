Released in 1973 by Columbia Records after Bob Dylan signed with David Geffen\u2019s Asylum Records for two albums (Planet Waves, Before The Flood), Dylan consists solely of covers, outtakes from his critically-dismissed 1970 double album Self Portrait and the much better received follow-up New Morning. The album was met with confused and negative reviews upon its release. However, in retrospect, it\u2019s an interesting album with a fair share of worthy curiosities. The cover of Joni Mitchell\u2019s \u201cBig Yellow Taxi\u201d may be a touch too surreal for some ears. But Dylan\u2019s take on Peter LaFarge\u2019s classic \u201cThe Ballad of Ira Hayes\u201d is touching, his version of the traditional \u201cLily of the West\u201d is only arguably marred by its back-up singers and his love for Elvis Presley can be heard on \u201cCan\u2019t Help Falling In Love\u201d and \u201cA Fool Such as I\u201d (though Dylan likely knew the Hank Snow version first), which have that casual sound that Dylan uses for all his endeavors.\u00a0, 127363=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
