Chatbear Announcements., 16595=CHERTSEY, UK \u2013 March 22, 2006 &ndash; Fight an all-out war for survival in the year 2142. Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: ERTS) and Sweden-based developer, Digital Illusions, today announced development of the next installment in the award-winning Battlefield\u2122 franchise, Battlefield 2142\u2122. The highly anticipated first-person shooter is scheduled to ship worldwide this winter for the PC. The year is 2142, and the dawn of a new Ice age has thrown the world into a panic. The math is simple and brutal: The soil not covered by ice can only feed a fraction of the Earth's population. Some will live, most will die. In Battlefield 2142, players will choose to fight for one of two military superpowers in an epic battle for survival, the European Union or the newly formed Pan Asian Coalition. Armed with a devastating arsenal of hi-tech assault rifles, cloaking devices and sentry guns, players will also do battle using some of the most imposing vehicles known to man. Massive battle Mechs wage fierce combat on the ground, while futuristic aircraft rule the skies. When facing one of these new behemoths, players will need to use their wits and an arsenal of new countermeasures like EMP grenades to level the playing field. \"Battlefield has long been synonymous with innovative, best-of-breed online multiplayer action,\" said Sean Decker, Executive Producer, DICE. \"By stepping into the future with Battlefield 2142, the team at DICE has reinvented the rules of engagement for the next century.\" Team play features allow up to 64 players to enter the action on the front lines as part of a formal squad, or work behind the scenes in Commander Mode to direct the strategic assaults of their teammates. With in-game success, players increase their rank and unlock awards, including new weapons, medals and more, delivering the most comprehensive and flexible persistence in the Battlefield universe to date., 62711=News CGI copyright \u00a9 1999-2015 James \"furn\" Furness & Blue's News.
