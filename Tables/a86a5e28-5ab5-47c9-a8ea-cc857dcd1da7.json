This is basically the FF album you can listen to at night and bring home to your parents: its calmer, more piano-driven than their other albums, and focused more on poppy, fun songs. The fast-paced lyrical wonder of Eleanor is still there, as well as the tight, semi-fractured instrumentation of brother Matt. All in all, a wonderful experience from beginning to end.
