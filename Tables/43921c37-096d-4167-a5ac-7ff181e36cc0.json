However, this is also the busiest time to travel so expect more people about, especially around Christmas and Easter. The wet season is from May to October. During this time, some activities and roads may be restricted; however, it usually only rains for around an hour or two in the afternoon. As this is the low season for travel, you can enjoy the sites with less people around., 79284=Gaining independence in 1821, Guatemala entered into the Mexican Empire and, for a brief period of time, also belonged to the United Provinces of Central America. By the 1900s, Guatemala had been subjected to many changes in government and power, having changed hands between a variety of dictators and insurgents via coups and civil war. Between1960 and 1996, the country endured the effects of the Guatemalan Civil War, which included genocide, economic hardship, violence and displacement. A peace process was underway by the late 1980s, but it took many years to restore democratic rule and peace to the country. More recently, Guatemala\u2019s economy has improved, mainly due to the strength of the local agriculture and tourism industries. Although there have been improvements in the economy of the country, unfortunately many Guatemalans still live in poverty., 78465=Before the Spanish arrived, the Mayan civilisation had long inhabited Guatemala and surrounding countries. Visitors will be able to see traces of this once mighty civilisation all over the country as a remarkable amount of well-preserved ruins still exist in Guatemala. It is thought that the Mayan civilisation was already in a state of decline by the time the Spanish arrived, and between 1523 and 1524 the Mayans were defeated. A Spanish colony was soon established. The first Guatemalan capital was destroyed by an earthquake and flooding in 1542, resulting in Antigua being established as the new capital. Although later earthquakes in 1773 caused widespread damage, much of the colonial-style architecture has been preserved and can be seen if visiting today.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading To learn more or donate, go to: www.theintrepidfoundation.org Organisations and projects currently supported by The Intrepid Foundation in Guatemala include: *CasaSito provides educational opportunities in rural areas of Guatemala for children living in poverty.
