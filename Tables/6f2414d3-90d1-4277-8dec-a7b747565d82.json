I miss that Bigger than my Body feel about his music, wish he'd go back to that stuff. This is a little too folksy for me, but, that said, he is my fave artist so of course I will buy and listen to it. Shadow Days is great! Beautiful Sounds \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Jeau An album worth buying in its entirety, the kind of album you listen to from start to finish as an album. A musical story. Sometimes foot tapping, sometimes reflective, always beautiful, always John Mayer. Highly recommended! Born again and raised to a new level! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
