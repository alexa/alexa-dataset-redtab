Great music and great lyrics. Serious Christian Metal band!!!! by bbarnetto \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Datum Point rocks!!!! Datum Point's album is simply amazing, it never gets old. I listen to it everyday. The best thing about Datum Point is that the lead singer, Dusty, has an amazing metal voice, but also has a great singing voice for the less intense songs. Also, they keep perfect beat regardless of how fast they go. Datum Point simply rocks, and they rock hard. by D.Bell_I2J \u00a0 \u00a0", "textAfterTable": "Listeners Also Bought Spooning Out the Sea Orphan Project View In iTunes Chapter II: Aftermath Harmony View In iTunes Death Machine Living Sacrifice View In iTunes", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
