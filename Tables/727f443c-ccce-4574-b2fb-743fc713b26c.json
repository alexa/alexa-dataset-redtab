Opening", "textAfterTable": "15 Songs Album Review After creating a buzz with guest appearances on the much-loved debut album from Major Lazer, dubstep singjay Jahdan Blakkamoore made his proper debut with Buzzrock Warrior, a very deep and dark effort with left-field production from the likes of DJ Rupture, Modeselektor, and Matt Shadetek. This heavy set of names is kept in check by the Anthony B.-and-Sizzla-inspired Jahdan, who through strength of will and the power of words keeps his career kickoff from being a producer's showcase. His moving observations make the grime-colored track \"Mesmerized\" a standout, and while he can act the cold-blooded lyrical killer on frantic dancehall workouts like \"Dem a Idiot,\" \"Runaround\" proves he's man enough to deliver an R&B-based, female-empowerment song with proper conviction. The druggy, reverb-heavy \"Earthshaking\" is just as advertised, and with the electro-jaunty \"Go Round Payola\" giving way to the dreamy, orchestral closer \"Rise Again,\" the album displays a strong curveball that lasts well into the ninth inning. Still, it's a little disappointing that such a diverse effort doesn't explore the reggae singer's more organic side further, but giving in to Buzzrock Warrior's electronic landscape is easy and in the end, very rewarding.
