This was the original U.S. album by the Bee Gees with two monster hits, Holiday and New York Mining Disaster, plus To Love Somebody which went on to become hits for several other artists. This album, probably more than almost any other, shows the immense range in songwriting (they were all originals) and performing that even the newly emerging brothers had. Along with all this, you get songs that seem retro, have georgian chants and are just plain fun. This is a must-have for any true fan, even more so than Main Course. Why any other number but five. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by PAUL'S WIFE People need to realize these brothers had more talent in their pinkies than most artists of today have in their whole body and without all the technology.
