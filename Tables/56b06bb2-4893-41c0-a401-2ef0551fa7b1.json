Admittedly, STP can sound like either Pearl Jam (\"Plush\"), Alice in Chains (\"Sex Type Thing\" and \"Wicked Garden\"), Soundgarden (\"Dead & Bloated\"), or even R.E.M. (\"Creep\"), depending on their mood, but their hooks are undeniably catchy, making the songs much better than they have any right to be. In fact, Stone Temple Pilots appear to be the hard rock arena act for the 1990s, and that's a compliment. Customer Reviews Can we fire the AMG reviewer? Please? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by lisasadler While I don't own the entire album, I've heard pretty much every song, and it is truly awesome. And nowhere will you hear an \"awful parody\" of another great band called Alice in Chains. I mean what is this, 17 years later and you guys are still rippin' on STP? Come on, just admit that they may have derived a bit from their peers (OK, a lot), but", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
