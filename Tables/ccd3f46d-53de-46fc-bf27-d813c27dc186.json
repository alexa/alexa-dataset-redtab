Now he and his crew, including Shannon Shaw of Shannon and the Clams, are tearing it up hardcore style on Street Punk, which bears all of the sass of its predecessors with added sneer and fuzz. It\u2019s a kick to hear Hunx scream \u201cI feel really fucked up!\u201d at the album\u2019s outset, or to hear Shannon tell everyone to fuck off on the brief \u201cEveryone\u2019s a Pussy (Fuck You).\u201d Whereas Hunx previously traded in scrappy, candy-coated odes to heartbreak, his songs here are more self-possessed \u2014 the title track is a great Stooges-style song about being a square peg, while Shannon has a great time decrying the \u201cfabulousness\u201d attributed to so many gays on \u201cDon\u2019t Call Me Fabulous.\u201d However, Hunx can\u2019t help but keep things tuneful, as on \u201cBorn Blonde,\u201d a funny jam about embracing your inner airhead. Hey cutie in the Crass shirt \u2014 Hunx wants your number.
