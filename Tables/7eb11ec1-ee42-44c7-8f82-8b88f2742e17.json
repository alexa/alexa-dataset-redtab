Three Fiddlers from the Show-Me State proves otherwise, offering a disc full of tunes recorded by Lyman Enloe, Casey Jones, and Cyril Stinnett. While these instrumentals were mostly recorded in the '70s, each of the fiddlers' styles actually goes back much further. In one way, County's method of placing three fiddlers with distinct styles side by side on this collection allows fans of fiddle music to compare and contrast the 21 selections. In another way, the collection allows a solid sampling of Missouri fiddle styles with origins in the 19th century. Three Fiddlers from the Show-Me State, then, is both a historical document of a regional style and a feast for fans of old-time fiddling. Of the three players, Jones' primal method seems to have the deepest roots, while Enloe easily passes for bluegrass. Stinnett falls somewhere between the two. Three Fiddlers from the Show-Me State is a dynamic recording, complete with full arrangements, and sure to please fans of old-time music and bluegrass. ~ Ronnie D.
