The original recordings, almost exclusively released by Victor, were cut over a span of years extending from 1908 to 1936. McCormack's polished yet often passionate delivery went over well both at the box office and with the gramophone record purchasing public, so much so that he is still regarded as one of the earliest (if certainly not the flashiest) superstars of the recording industry. His works mesh well with those of his contemporary Sir Harry Lauder and their followers Sydney Mac Ewen and Josef Locke. Indeed some may feel that he surpassed them all with his expressive interpretations of \"The Irish Emigrant,\" \"The Rose of Tralee,\" \"The Bard of Armagh,\" and \"The Ould Turf Fire.\", 23974=Born: June 14, 1884 in Athlone, Ireland, 97305=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
