In the case of Chris Shiflett, he eschews the radio-rock of Dave Grohl and co. as well as his past as a punk guitarist with the straight-up honky tonk rock of Chris Shiflett & the Dead Peasants. His second album with the country-rock outfit the Dead Peasants is a beer-swillin\u2019 set of jukebox jams about double dealin\u2019 and woman stealin\u2019. Though you needn\u2019t know Shiflett\u2019s other work to enjoy All Hat and No Cattle, as any classic country fan should feel at home here, those looking for Shiflett\u2019s electrifying guitarwork will find it all over the place, as on the harmonic riffs of \u201cGood Time Charlies,\u201d sneaking some glam rock into traditional square-dance territory. His band are no slouches, either, imbuing the songs with reverence for AM country gold with steel guitar and saloon piano in \u201cGuitar Pickin\u2019 Man.\u201d Pop a top and saddle up with All Hat and No Cattle. 07/29/2013 Amoeba Review Download CD, Also available in: SHIPS FREE in U.S. $18.98 BUY", "textAfterTable": "BUY $18.98 SHIPS FREE in U.S. Also available in: CD , Download User Reviews Overall Rating 0 Submissions RATE & REVIEW Who We Are Amoeblog Buy Sell Trade News & Contests Gift Certificates Contact Us Support & FAQ Sign-up for email news, sales alerts & more:", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
