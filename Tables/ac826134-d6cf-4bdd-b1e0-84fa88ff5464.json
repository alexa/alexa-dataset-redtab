Need You Now appeared in early 2010, and its leadoff single \u2014 \"Need You Now\" \u2014 became the group's highest-charting song to date, topping the country charts and peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. It eventually sold over three million copies. The album experienced similar success, going gold during its second week of release and reaching platinum status soon after. By early 2011, Need You Now had sold more than three million copies in America alone, and the band took a break from recording a third studio album in order to attend the Grammys, where Lady Antebellum took home five awards., 38166=Lady Antebellum blend contemporary country with soulful '60s R&B into an infectious brew that relies on the trio's rich harmonies and impeccable instrumental skills. The trio was formed in 2006 by Charles Kelley (brother of singer/songwriter Josh Kelley), Hillary Scott (daughter of Grammy-winning country artist Linda Davis), and Dave Haywood, and soon graduated from dive bars to the Grand Ole Opry. Their 2009 single \"Need You Now\" became the first of many hits to reach not just the country Top Ten but the pop Top Ten as well., 35505=In May of 2013, Lady Antebellum released Golden, their fourth full-length studio album. Preceded by the hit single \"Downtown,\" Golden entered the Billboard charts at number one, but its second single, \"Goodbye Town,\" underperformed. The album was revived by a deluxe edition released in November of 2013, thanks to the inclusion of the single \"Compass.\" Written by the pop-making machine Stargate, \"Compass\" became a Top Ten country single in early 2014. The trio quickly followed Golden with 747 in the fall of 2014; helmed by Nathan Chapman, it was their first record not produced by Paul Worley. \"Bartender,\" the record's first single, became a Top Ten country single prior to the album's release. ~ James Christopher Monger & Andrew Leahey, Rovi, 37592=The group formed when Scott met Kelley and Haywood in Nashville, and after a few months of performing around the area, they signed with Capitol Nashville in 2007. Lady Antebellum's first single, \"Love Don't Live Here,\" peaked at number three on the country charts. A self-titled debut album followed in April 2008, featuring production from Victoria Shaw and Paul Worley and stocked with more country hits (including the chart-topping single \"I Run to You,\" which also enjoyed crossover success as a Top 40 pop hit).}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{115034=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
