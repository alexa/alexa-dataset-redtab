Listening to Dress British, Look Irish, Think Yiddish (check those initials), a collection of recordings the band left behind, it's not impossible to see why they didn't catch the brass ring, but there's enough smarts, hooks, and potent guitar work to suggest they could have matured into a Cheap Trick-styled hard rock juggernaut under the right circumstances. If \"Rock and Roll Magazine,\" \"Jailbait,\" and \"Get Down or Get Out\" aren't always as clever as the band seems to think they are, they're still unexpectedly witty stuff with full-bodied guitar leads from Obby Noxious and hyperactive drum work from T.L.
