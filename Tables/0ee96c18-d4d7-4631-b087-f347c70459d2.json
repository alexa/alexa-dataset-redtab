I'm pretty sure that Ninten, Ana and Lloyd are the confirmed names of the EarthBound Zero heroes. 6: The colour of Lloyd and Ana's hair is very different from that of Jeff and Paula. Lloyd and Ana have somewhat dirty blonde hair, whereas Jeff and Paula have blonde hair. What are the chances of a child's hair changing colour in six years, which I think is not possible unless it is dyed? Anyway, the dye should have washed off when Ness, Jeff and Paula went under Grapefruit Falls, and if not, it should have when they got to Deep Darkness. The water would have saturated the hair enough to drain the dye. 5: Wouldn't Ness's version of Magicant have included some sort of memory of the Paradise Express train line if he was an older version of Ninten? 4: Why don't Ness'", "textAfterTable": "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Junk: Weird Junk: Earthbound Thing of the Day.
