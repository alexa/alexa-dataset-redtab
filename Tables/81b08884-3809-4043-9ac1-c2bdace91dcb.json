Vaughan and Pia Guerra published by Vertigo beginning in 2002. The series is about the seemingly only man who survives the apparent simultaneous death of all other male mammals on Earth except the man's pet monkey. The series was published in sixty issues by Vertigo and collected in a series of ten paperback volumes (and later a series of five hardcover \"Deluxe\" volumes). The series's covers were primarily by J. G. Jones and Massimo Carnevale. The series received five Eisner Awards., 25796=The film rights to the series were acquired by New Line Cinema (a sister company to Vertigo), and as of July 24, 2007 screenwriter Carl Ellsworth and director D. J. Caruso, the team behind Disturbia, were attached to the project with David S. Goyer as a producer.[5], 31691=In January 2013, it was announced that Dan Trachtenberg will direct the film.[16] In June 2013, producer David Goyer announced having \"a script that\u2019s as close as it\u2019s ever been,\" and suggested the film could go into production in 2014.[17] However, in January 2014, Brian K. Vaughan stated \"It's my understanding that the rights to Y: The Last Man will revert back to co-creator Pia Guerra and me for the first time in a decade if the planned New Line adaptation doesn't start shooting in the next few months.\"[18] On September 24, Trachtenberg confirmed via Twitter the film was \"Not happening.

The script would be a rewrite of the original draft written by Jeff Vintar. Although Vintar's draft was faithful to the original comic book and considered by many to be a success, the higher-ups at New Line Cinema seemed unable to fully embrace the material. A subsequent draft by Vaughan himself, which departed from his own comic considerably, was even less successful in convincing the studio to proceed.[6], 30716=In March 2012, former Jericho writers Matthew Federman and Stephen Scaia entered final negotiations to write New Line's adaptation of the series, following in the footsteps of Vintar, Vaughan, and Ellsworth. J.C. Spink, Chris Bender and David Goyer were attached to produce; Mason Novick and Jake Weiner are executive producers.[14] Reports in September 2012 suggested New Line was enthusiastic about the draft screenplay produced by Federman and Scaia, and had begun the process of meeting potential directors to hire for the project.[15], 38765=In 2014, the first Absolute Edition was announced, a specialty over-sized slipcovered edition., 11962=On July 17, 2002, all living mammals with a Y chromosome \u2014 including embryos and sperm simultaneously die, with the exception of a young amateur escape artist named Yorick Brown and his Capuchin monkey, Ampersand. Many women die from disasters caused by the men's deaths, such as plane crashes. Society is plunged into chaos as infrastructures collapse, and the surviving women everywhere try to cope with the loss of the men, and the belief that, barring a rapid, major scientific breakthrough or other extraordinary happening, humanity is doomed to extinction., 39748=Y: The Last Man, Volume 10: Whys and Wherefores was nominated for the first Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story.
