Indie harpist Joanna Newsom makes a small vocal contribution on an opening, note-perfect rendition of \u201cThe Muppet Show Theme Song.\u201d Hearing Feist lend her silky inflections to the Mickey Rooney\u2013sung \u201cLife\u2019s a Happy Song\u201d (penned by Flight of the Conchords' Bret McKenzie) is just as endearingly random and smile-inducing. It\u2019s impossible not to laugh out loud while hearing the Muppet-assembled barbershop quartet\u2019s hilarious cover of Nirvana\u2019s \u201cSmells Like Teen Spirit.\u201d Actor Jason Segel sings the sidesplitting \u201cMan or Muppet,\u201d briefly recalling his work with similarly spongy characters on the 2008 comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall. There are also a few non-Muppet household hits in the mix, like Paul Simon\u2019s playful \u201cMe and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\u201d and Starship\u2019s \u201cWe Built This City.\u201d}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 03:54:16 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "View In iTunes Bohemian Rhapsody (Muppets Version) - Single 5.
