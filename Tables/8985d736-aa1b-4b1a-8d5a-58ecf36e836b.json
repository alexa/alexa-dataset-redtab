DISTURBIA is a sure hit, and i don't know a single person who doesn't love it. the beat, the catchy tune, the lyrics that make u stop and think... WAY TO GO, RIHANNA! Rihanna, Codename: Musical Genius \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by trosema1 I have so much respect for this girl because she does an amazing job with everything she puts her name on. This CD came out last year and is still selling copies. Song after song has been made a #1 single, first with Umbrella, then Shut up and Drive, then Dont stop the music, Then Take a Bow and surely disturbia with its fantastic beat and pure catchy sound will not fail to become a bigtime sensation as well. Rihanna is a genius. Rihanna has done it again! \u00a0", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
