I know my 500/8 (newest version) can deliver sharp images but it is very difficult to \"hit\" focus. So it would be nice if the \"green dot\" in the finder worked. Also macro shots on distance the 500/8 can be great (it can focus very close). I saw a nikkor 6/2.8 fisheye on ebay...maybe it was something for you? ....it seems you have many of the exotic nikkors. The most exotic I have is a noct nikkor.}", "textBeforeTable": "AlertQuoteReply Have some of you tried the Reflex nikkor 500/8 on e.g. D5100, D5200 or D3200?
