However, upon editing the menu item, there is no \"restrict visibility\" anywhere to be seen. After installation of the module, I enabled it, and have now gone to edit a menu item - so that I can restrict visibility to users with certain user roles. I am using Drupal Core 6.24, with Menu Per Role version 6.x-1.11.

As far as I know, if you are the administrator (UID = 1) then you should always see the menu restriction checkboxes. I was on 6.24 not that long ago and am on 6.26 now and it works on my systems. I don't recall having to tweak anything in Core to make it work (as was the case a while back, but the problem was with the save, not the visibility.) Thank you.
