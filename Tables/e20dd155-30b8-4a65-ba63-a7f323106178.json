His programs went into exhaustive detail on individual artists, labels and musical disciplines. He also spearheaded many important events on the air, such as the 2001 and 2008 Dada and Surrealism festivals that dominated the airwaves for days on end and involved many in the local avant garde community as well as many KBOO programmers. Richard passed away in 2009 but it's our hope to carry on with his mission of introducing listeners to unheard new music as a collective of his collaborators and listeners.

He leaves behind a great legacy of friendships and large amounts of recorded sound art and truly unique visual art, speaking of the 6000+ photos he took recently of various naturally eroded materials while hiking, strange arrangements of objects and other various abstractions, as he always had the exquisite skill of channelling the fascinating and odd through any number of mediums. Whether it was with mud, paint and found objects, scissors, magazines, trash and glue, hallucinogenic photo manipulations on a computer, or an amplified birdcage tickled with a gigantic comb, Damian was endlessly enthralled by creating. He was a collector of junk materials and built his own instruments and sculptures. The music of Agog was homemade musique concrete - amazing tape collages. It was really outstanding work that stood above a lot of what was coming out of the cassette culture at that time. Damian's work was superbly recorded and edited, and lovingly packaged. His own cassettes reached fewer and fewer people over the years as his packaging grew more and more elaborate. Damian's music and art remains little heard and known for the most part.
