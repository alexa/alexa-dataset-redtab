But their seventh, Primitive & Deadly, is only the second to have vocals. As the band has evolved to strip down some of the corrosive feedback that marked their early work and have added in more Americana and jazz-based elements, this addition of vocals can just be seen as another development in their sound, especially when they\u2019re so effective.
