It's on for the rest of today as well as tomorrow (Monday 18th October 2010) http://www.itadakizen.com/, 23726=Lots of very interesting foods including a 'home' made miso from Japan called jyoutyou miso made with rice, soybeans and flavored with garlic, ginger, bamboo leaf extract and sesame http://mannane.shop-pro.jp/?pid=21581962, bamboo leaf tea (a kit of bamboo leaves and buckwheat grouts that you need to simmer for thirty minutes http://mannane.shop-pro.jp/?pid=20803516), a delicious pickle made with a Scottish garlic that looked similar to pickled shiso seeds (unfortunately, this wasn't for sale), vegan sushi rice with Scottish seaweed, a peanut, black sesame and sea salt furikake, zakkokumai mixes, vegan kimchi (this had a good satisfying aftertaste) and I also bought a kind of kimchi pepper sauce made with chilli, mochi rice, onions, garlic and ginger http://mannane.shop-pro.jp/?pid=17258999 - I'll use this to make cucumber kimchi as I have a huge bowl of cucumbers I need to use up. And there was more besides. We also bought a bag of a Scottish stone similar to charcoal. Once it's been cleaned you put the stones in a jug, cover with water overnight and the next day you have purified, better tasting water - we're hoping it will improve some of our teas., 7714=Between April/May and November, Nama yasai will be recommencing their vegetable box delivery service in the South East of England. http://www.namayasai.co.uk/index.htm}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:22:57 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "New forum activity since your last visit More information about formatting options Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.
