She's an artist to be treasured. Brilliant! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by J.Me What else can be said of this album other than that it is simply amazing? Adele's voice is powerful, vulnerable, assured, and heartbreaking all in one fell swoop. While most of today's pop stars rely on auto-tune, guest rappers, and flashy video pyrotechnics, Adele brings music back to it's core and makes you feel and hear every word she sings. Dripping with emotion. Drenched in rawness. Dipped in heartache. Adele's \"21\" belies her age and leaves you salivating for the next chapter in her sure to be illustrious career. I smell a Grammy for 2011's Album of the Year. Flawless \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by William Carley", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
