It is, at the same time, a golden opportunity for him to collaborate with some of his all-time favorite female vocalists. In the liner notes booklet, Prine tells the story: \"I made a list of my favorite girl singers and the first nine I called said 'yes.' I nearly fell over.\" One of Prine's favorites is Iris DeMent, and her unique vocals grace four of the tracks here, including \"(We're Not) The Jet Set,\" \"We Could,\" and Prine's lone songwriting appearance, \"In Spite of Ourselves,\" a song written for the upcoming Billy Bob Thornton film, Daddy & Them, in which Prine appears. Trisha Yearwood, Connie Smith, Fiona Prine, Melba Montgomery, Emmylou Harris, Delores Keane, Patty Loveless, and Lucinda Williams all share the studio with Prine, creating some mighty powerful duets. From Freddie Hart's \"Loose Talk\" to Don Everly's \"So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad),\" the album manages to create a seamless scrapbook of both old and new songs, artists and memories. Prine's duets are backed by some of the very best musicians available. Buddy Emmons and Dan Dugmore, two incredible pedal steel players, and Sam Bush,", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
