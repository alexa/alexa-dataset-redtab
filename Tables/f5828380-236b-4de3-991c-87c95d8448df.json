Thankfully for listeners, the guys are not only alive and kicking, but they've also not yet lost their gritty edge or irrepressible exuberance. For their Volcom debut, they've simply developed their manic approach to one that is slightly more sober and aware. After all, having dealt with insincere A&R reps who appeared at their door in the wake of 2003's Something to Crow About \u2014 reflected upon in wry songs like the punchy \"Biz Loves Sluts\" \u2014 the guys are hardly na\u00efve upstarts. But while the Gamblers may initially seem more sharply polished than on prior efforts, there is absolutely no dilution of the volatile energy they've been raucously discharging over the years (check them out live if you want further proof). Things are still very much fun and dirty, just not the all-encompassing filthy sweat of before.
