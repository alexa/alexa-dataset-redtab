Saposins are a class of proteins involved in sphingolipid catabolism and antigen presentation of lipids in humans. Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase, which they nicknamed swaposin.[7] Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation.[7], 26781=Hundreds of examples of protein pairs related by a circular permutation were subsequently discovered in nature or produced in the laboratory. As of February 2012, the Circular Permutation Database[8] contains 2,238 circularly permuted protein pairs with known structures, and many more are known without structures.[9] The CyBase database collects proteins that are cyclic, some of which are permuted variants of cyclic wild-type proteins.[10] SISYPHUS is a database that contains a collection of hand-curated manual alignments of proteins with non-trivial relationships, several of which have circular permutations.[11], 29265=After the discovery of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin.[5] In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA.[6] This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.[6], 30426=In 1979, Bruce Cunningham and his colleagues discovered the first instance of a circularly permuted protein in nature.[1] After determining the peptide sequence of the lectin protein favin, they noticed its similarity to a known protein\u00a0\u2013 concanavalin A\u00a0\u2013 except that the ends were circularly permuted. Later work confirmed the circular permutation between the pair[2] and showed that concanavalin A is permuted post-translationally[3] through cleavage and an unusual protein ligation.[4], 38098=A circular permutation is a relationship between proteins whereby the proteins have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence. The result is a protein structure with different connectivity, but overall similar three-dimensional (3D) shape. In 1979, the first pair of circularly permuted proteins \u2013 concanavalin A and lectin \u2013 were discovered; over 2000 such proteins are now known.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 25 Jul 2015 10:24:18 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "The algorithms are classified according to the type of input they require. Sequence-based algorithms require only the sequence of two proteins in order to create an alignment.[36] Sequence methods are generally fast and suitable for searching whole genomes for circularly permuted pairs of proteins.[36] Structure-based methods require 3D structures of both proteins being considered.[37] They are often slower than sequence-based methods, but are able to detect circular permutations between distantly related proteins with low sequence similarity.[37] Some structural methods are topology independent, meaning that they are also able to detect more complex rearrangements than circular permutation.[38] Many sequence alignment and protein structure alignment algorithms have been developed assuming linear data representations and as such are not able to detect circular permutations between proteins.[34] Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models.[34] As an alternative to these, a number of algorithms are built on top of non-linear approaches and are able to detect topology-independent similarities, or employ modifications allowing them to circumvent the limitations of dynamic programming.[34][35] The table below is a collection of such methods.
