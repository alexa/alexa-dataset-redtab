It only seems like yesterday that we began to play set two of 8-28-82 set 2. Why, it was on August 28th 2010! The 28th Anniversary of the 2nd Decadenal Field Trip at the Country Fairgrounds in Veneta!!! We began the broadcast by ballyhooing the new Grateful Dead Road Trips Vol.3 No.4 featuring Penn State, and Cornell 1980. Me And My Uncle, and Big River got a good workout from the Penn State Recreation Hall 5-6-90. Road Trips are available at WWW.DEAD.NET\u00a0right now!\u00a0 After the Road Trips Debut, we picked up where we left off on Veneta 82. As a footnote, I have a cool story about last months show. When I got home, I found an email on the WWW.KBOODEADSHOW@GMAIL.Com\u00a0From Eli Babbs. It seems that somebody called him to tell him that his Dad's (Kenn Babbs)\u00a0voice was on KBOO on Grateful Dead and Friends. So he tuned in and had a great time listening to the rest of the show. I emailed him back and Mathew and I arranged to meet him and his honey Sandy for a brew or two. Because of that meeting, he agreed to come on Matts show the next week. I hope this won't be the last we see of Eli, and the Pranksters! Anyway, with Tom Chiles and Bill Carver in the passenger seat, we finished 8-28-82 set 2. To fill out the rest of the show, we played 2 songs from the first set of Furthur at Cuthbert Amphitheater in Eugene on 9-16-10. Don't forget\u00a0Eli Babbs band The Lost\u00a0Creek Gang\u00a0will be at the goodfoot Lounge 2845 S.E. Stark (Also Twisted Whistle).\u00a0It is a 21 and older event, and gets under way at 9:00. Then on the 8th, A\u00a0benefit\u00a0will be\u00a0put on by Garcia Birthday Band for KBOO\u00a0at the Tonic Lounge at 3100 N.E. Sandy Blvd. Come on out and dance the night away, Support KBOO, and get ready for the 15th Anniversary Grateful Dead 12 hour Marathon on the 9th 12:00 Noon Till Midnight!
