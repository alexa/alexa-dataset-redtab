Every single track is outstanding and could be a hit. They deserve serious recognition for their work. I really enjoy their unique sound. Obviously their sound is rooted in the 80\u2019s, but there are so many additional elements in the music that make it new and exciting. The best way I can describe their sound is that if Madonna, The Human League, Information Society, and Goldfrapp all got together and collaborated on an album, it would sound like Electricity. Electricity is definitely worth buying if you want to hear something fresh. Great Sound! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by OTRD85 I heard about Parralox online, and I have to say I'm quite impressed. I like the beat and lyric content. Fantastic!!
