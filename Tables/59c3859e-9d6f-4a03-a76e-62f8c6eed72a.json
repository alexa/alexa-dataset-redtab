All rights reserved., 21723=I don't like \"Quick Turns\" as much as their extraordinary debut \"On\"...but that is mainly because I prefer the classic '70's sound of \"On\". Production-wise \"Quick Turns\" sounds much more like an '80's record, which I assume was their intention, given that they recorded it in 1980, and it thus sounded quite contemporary at the time. Be that as it may, it is indeed quite a fine LP. Cliff Johnson + John Ivan = power pop magic...this band was so terrific, it so sad that they only made two proper records in their heyday. The tunes are good...the performances are great...the arrangements are terrific! When it comes to classic power pop there are very few bands who can hang with the great Off Broadway.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 08:10:05 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Open iTunes to preview, buy, and download music.

The mileage Off Broadway gets from a clich\u00e9 remains nothing less than extraordinary: \"U.S. Girls\" cops an age-old opening from the Beatles; \"Eddie's Pals\" delivers a power pop missive almost in a league with the Hollies' \"Dear Eloise\" (or maybe Rundgren's \"We Gotta Get You a Woman,\" but at least REO's \"In Your Letter\"). \"Boys Must Be Strong\" pleads poignantly and painfully long before the Cure's \"Boys Don't Cry.\" Even without Tom Werman on the boards (he guided Off Broadway's inaugural On, and also produced hometown heroes Cheap Trick before he transmogrified into a pop-metal maven), Quick Turns is a pleasing platter impossible to resist. ~ Whitney Z.
