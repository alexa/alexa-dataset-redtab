Just what Fitz said... & that year he got ZERO TDs against him...... I tell you what, I got Fitzgerald in future game match ups and you got Ron Bartell. Lets see who gets shutdown and who gets touchdowns. Bartell was \"close\" many times, when did he ever finish the deal? The numbers dont lie. Fitzgerald could torch Bartell anytime he wanted. Probably just politely setting a trap for \"the next time\" to get Bartell's comfort zone up and then keep plucking passes directed his way if Bartell was LOL \"covering\" him.
