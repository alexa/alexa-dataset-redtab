Erika sings of her childhood growing up in a tiny village on the Swedish island of Orust\u2014in the same home that\u2019s been in her family for generations. The recordings themselves were made in Montreal, an ocean apart. She, husband Simon, and a small band combined to explore a variety of vintage tones; they make their presence especially felt on the title track, where keyboardist Parker Shper adds vintage organ. Simon\u2019s guitar work casts different tones over the remaining songs, and hearing just a cut or two will hardly explain what\u2019s happening on Thus Owls\u2019 third album. \u201cAs Long As We Try a Little\u201d settles at the piano for a straightforward ballad centered on the strategic double-tracking of Erika\u2019s voice.
