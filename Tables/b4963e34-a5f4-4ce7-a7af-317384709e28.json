Rex\u2019s Marc Bolan, alone and stoned in his room and writing perfect power-pop gems. But like Bolan before him, who started with a few English folk albums before going glam, King Tuff aka Kyle Thomas seems to have set his sights higher this time around, filling out the sound with full-bodied heavy rock riffs and pushing his nasal wail into a wolf\u2019s howl.

Though there\u2019s a winking hair-metal touch to Black Moon Spell, songs like \u201cHeadbanger\u201d (complete with demonic opening) don\u2019t stray so far from the glam-garage foundation that it\u2019s jarring\u2014and Thomas\u2019 voice is too cartoonish and the songs are too damn catchy to really scare off any garage kids, anyway. Even a song called \u201cDemon From Hell\u201d is more fey and punk than hellish, despite pushing the sound into the red. If there\u2019s one thing Black Moon Spell is, it\u2019s a great guitar album, as songs like \u201cEyes of the Muse\u201d prove, starting with a \u201970s AM radio gold jangle and moving into psychedelic, searching riffs, while Bobby Harlow\u2019s production practically places the drums in your living room. There hasn\u2019t been a better album released this year to play air guitar and drums to than Black Moon Spell., 1363=09/22/2014}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 03:59:07 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Track Listing When King Tuff released his breakthrough self-titled album in 2012, he came off as a successor to T.
