This Fresh Sound two-CD set collects everything recorded during these sessions. Scott's core group features pianist Bill Evans (not long after he was discharged from military service), either Milt Hinton or Henry Grimes on bass, and drummer Paul Motian. In addition to his powerful clarinet, Scott plays a potent baritone sax on six selections. The music includes a few standards, a handful of originals by Scott, and some obscure compositions. Trombonist Jimmy Knepper is a guest on several songs, providing a perfect foil for the leader in a snappy take of \"The Lady Is a Tramp,\" with the soloing on clarinet and baritone saxophonist Sahib Shihab following Knepper. Trumpeter Clark Terry (still with Duke Ellington at the time) blows a very soft solo in a subdued arrangement of \"Tenderly.\" Even though Evans was yet to make his mark as a leader or composer, his \"Five\" is heard in extended form rather than as a brief signoff as he played on early recording dates of his own. He also solos brilliantly in \"There Will Never Be Another You.\" The title to this collection is a bit misleading, as trustworthy discographies list these sessions as being recorded over several days. Because obtaining each of the originally issued LPs is likely to be very expensive for collectors, this comprehensive CD set is the better alternative., 48666=Born: 17 June 1921 in Morristown, NJ}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:52:23 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Open iTunes to preview, buy and download music.
