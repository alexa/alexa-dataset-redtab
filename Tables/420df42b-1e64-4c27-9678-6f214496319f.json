Enter Might Bear Seven (an enemy with one of the more intriguing names in EB, I'd say -- what ever DID happen to the other Might Bears?... Plus, his fur is bluish green. What 's up with THAT?!). I even tried to keep the bulish purple from the original sprite in there. And I've got to say, I really like how this one turned out in the end. :D", "The cute little Bubble Monkey!", "In doing a lot of drawing based on the EB characters and enemies, I spend a good deal of time looking through the original sprites for inspiration and reference. There are some though, that I figure I'll never get to, just because they're not as visually exciting as others. The Electro Swoosh fit into the \"not interesting enough to draw\" category for me for a good, long time, before I decided to send a little love and affection its way. I tried to re-think it a bit, had some fun and come up with this, and I'm glad that I did.", "Electro Specter emerging from a pile of liquid metal. The Electro Specter is another enemy that I'd not had a lot of interest in drawing for a good while. It wasn't until I was reading through the Player's Guide one day and read that it was \"a lethal combination of energy and molten metal\" that I was inspired to do this, one of my very favorite pieces of my EB art. In my mind, I pictured a pool of liquid metal (a la Terminator 2) running uphill and morphing up into the Electro Specter, electricity arcing from it as it solidified. I also envisionned vein-like tunnels of the liquid rushing up, not unlike lava tubes. I feel that I'd captured all of that pretty successfully. I also opted for axe-like and hammer-like \"hands\", to illustrate a \"morphing\" type ability."], ["Date", "4/27/05", "4/27/05", "4/27/05", "4/27/05", "4/27/05"], ["Rank", "8.00", "7.00", "0.00", "0.00", "8.58"]], "pageTitle": "STARMEN.NET - EarthBound / Mother 3 Goodness.", "title": "", "url": "http://starmen.net/vote/vote.php?id=18029&stuff=DateDESC&stuffPageNumber=96", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042987127.36/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002307-00238-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 220206123, "recordOffset": 220197921, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "textBeforeTable": "> 1 < Other Submissions by ozwalled One of the Tessie watchers spying the Loch Tess Monster.
