In addition to the three long-players Who I Am (1975), Everything's Coming Up Love (1976) and In My Stride (1977), there are a dozen \"lost and found\" cuts from throughout Ruffin's career. Unlike fellow Temptations frontman Eddie Kendricks, Ruffin 's style of disco drone flourished. Much of that is undoubtedly thanks to an association with the one and only Van \"Do the Hustle\" McCoy. Who I Am (1975) would be the highest charting crossover LP that Ruffin had enjoyed since his debut My Whole World Ended (1969) six years prior. Ironically, each respectively peaked at a commendable number 33 on the pop survey. The success of Who I Am benefited from two light and breezy Philly soul influenced singles \"Walk Away from Love\" and its soundalike follow-up \"Heavy Love.\" On the other side of the spectrum is the gorgeous and introspective \"Statue of a Fool.\" Everything's Coming Up Love (1976) doesn't go very far off the path and is perhaps best remembered \u2014 especially by supporters of the pugilistic arts \u2014 for Ruffin's cover of McCoy's \"First Round Knock Out\" \u2014 a tune also done by boxing great Joe Frasier. The title track, \"Everything's Coming Up Love,\" has a grandiose Love Unlimited Orchestra feel that", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
