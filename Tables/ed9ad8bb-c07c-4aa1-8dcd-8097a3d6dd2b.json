Please visit my blog for more information on this and other projects. We are currently on Version 2.1, the seventh release of this hack. 2.1 repairs a glitch with Cid\u2019s ability to equip heavy armors and helmets which was introduced in the last release. Thank you to everyone who tried this hack! Please note that the changes introduced by this hack are relatively minor up until Cecil and friends reach Troia. The changes become more pronounced after Cid rescues the team from the Tower of Bab-il. With that said, surprises are sprinkled along the way to hold the player\u2019s interest. Other changes include: a modified party lineup at various points throughout the game, many new equipment and tool items, the restoration of dummied commands and spells, overall refinement of the script, and more. This hack alters events of the game such that Golbez joins the party after Cecil and friends destroy the Giant of Bab-il. The story has been tweaked in various ways so that this development makes sense in context.
