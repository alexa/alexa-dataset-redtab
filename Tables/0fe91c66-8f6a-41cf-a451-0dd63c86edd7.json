It is a Skinny Puppy masterpiece! Their ingenious shows on this like all others and beyond, and there are so many layers of depth in electronics and industrial noise that it is easy to get lost in; it will bring you to an altered state completely. They originally made 40 to 50 songs for this one album, designed mixed and created for just this purpose, and they chose their favorite nine to be released. Can you imagine what it would be like to see Skinny Puppy's full set of recorded history? From what I've heard, just a fraction of it would be intimidating. These guys work constantly to perfect their music and make it worth listening to, and they have a lot to say. One of them unfortunately died seven years after this release. But Skinny Puppy always touches up on the subjects that others always try to avoid, and this is one album that really should not be missed. I strongly recommend this album.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
