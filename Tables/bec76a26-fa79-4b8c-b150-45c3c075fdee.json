I have set up the client/farm/field in my office software. I connect the Nomad and make sure mobile is not running. I click the sync button in office. I make sure the CE device is selected and make sure the information I want to transfer is also selected. It all seems to go fine. When I open mobile, the client/farm/fields that I have set up are not there - they didn't transfer over. I have FW office software and mobile software. The mobile is running on a Nomad. I am trying to sync between office and mobile.
