This album is particually interesting because you can see the early stages of Sonny's shift to dance/dubstep from metal. Mora (track 2) is the big highlight for me personally. If you're in doubt just buy track 1 and 2! love it! I love sonny Moore! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Purdy Chav I love sonny Moore Best songs are gypsyhook and mora, ITUNES PLEASE GET MORE OF HIS ALBUMS LIKE THE ONE WITH glowworm!
