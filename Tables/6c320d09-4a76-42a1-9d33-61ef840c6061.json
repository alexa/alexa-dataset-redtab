2010 A look at the Dada-infused group from Sheffield UK, Cabaret Voltaire. Cabaret Voltaire formed in 1973, around Richard H. Kirk, Stephen Mallinder and Chris Watson. Initially utilizing minimal electronics and tape to make their highly original sounds, they eventually incorporated Funk, dance and Dub in the mix and released numerous singles, EPs and albums. Watson left the group in the early 80\u2032s to pursue a career in television and has since gained acclaim as an environmental sound recordist. Cabaret Voltaire\u2019s output slowed to a crawl in the Nineties and there has yet to be a proper CV recording in this century. Richard H. Kirk continues to put out releases under his own name, as Sandoz, Biochemical Dread and more. He has lately said in interviews that the last three or four Cabaret Voltaire albums were the work of himself alone., 110095=Latest newsletter: May 2015, 3467=Neil Simon's You Ought To Be In Pictures ...

After a little bit of fun and frivolity, we finished some past buisness by playing the remainder of Madison Square Garden 09-09-91 SBD. At this point, we aired a beautiful \"Killer Audience Tape\" of The Jerry Garcia Band at The Orpheum Theater in Boston Ma. 12-02-77 Early Show. This has always been a favorite of mine. I was given a cassette copy of a bootleg album called \"The Grateful Dead Featuring Jerry Garcia Boston Ma. 12-02-77. (Bootleg albums were famous for not getting it right). This was a fine performance of a very up show! Content worthy of playing for everyone in the family! We were joined about midway through the program by Scotty Gillan from The Jerry Garcia Birthday Band to talk about Jerry's Birthday at The McMenamens Edgefield. This is where the J.G.B.B. got it's start, playing sets every year on Jerry's Birthday. Boy! What a fabulous weekend for DeadHeads! Saturday night at the Tonic Lounge, Tom Wright brought his Garcia cover\u00a0band \"Cats Down Under The Stars\" in for a Jerry Garcia Band hoedown!\u00a0(Tom also fronts \"Ramblin' Rose\",\u00a0the\u00a0Grateful Dead cover band). And then the Garcia Birthday thing at The Edgefield! (With The Freak Mountain Ramblers putting the cap on a perfect day!). Tom Chiles is taking a little time off to get some things taken care of, and we hope he will be back very soon! I'll be on the air again August 28th.
