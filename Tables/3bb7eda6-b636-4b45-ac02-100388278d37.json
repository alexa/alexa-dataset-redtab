Whether on alto, tenor, baritone, or flute, Niewood sounds distinctive and inspired. Among the highlights of this straight-ahead set are the samba \"Ruby,\" which has a flute melody and a strong alto solo, two-tenor jams with Gerry's son Adam on \"Cheek to Cheek\" and \"Doxy,\" a baritone/guitar duo with Gene Bertoncini on \"I Concentrate on You,\" a heated tenor/bass/drums trio version of \"Just One of Those Things\" in the style of Sonny Rollins, and a beautiful baritone solo on \"All Too Soon.\" Throughout this definitive date, Gerry Niewood shows just how strong an improviser he has always been. Highly recommended. Biography Born: 06 April 1943 in Rochester, NY Genre: Jazz Years Active: '80s, '90s, '00s Gerry Niewood was best known for his association with Chuck Mangione.
