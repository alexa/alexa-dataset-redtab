It's been a while since I played through EB and for some crazy reason (I blame the Player's Guide) I could have SWORN that there were Bionic Krakens in the Sea of Eden.

Some of the pictures I love doing most are based upon nifty ideas that come to me, and this is a prime example of that. Another fun one. Note that my younger brother had one of the brand name ant farms as a kid, so this is sort of a throwback to that old thing. I'd thought about throwing in the green silhouetted silo, farmhous and tractor and stuff at the surface, but decided they'd only be a distraction, and that people who were unfamiliar with the ol' green plastic ant farm might not get it anyway.", "Poo using his \"Mirror\" ability to transform into a mook. I don't know about you, but I never much used Poo's \"Mirror\". I drew this one mostly because I think it's a shame that more people haven't depicted his \"Mirroring\" in action.", "Poor guy... This one actually started with the background, which is rarely how I start character art. Somehow, the background felt like it needed a Worthless Protoplasm on it.
