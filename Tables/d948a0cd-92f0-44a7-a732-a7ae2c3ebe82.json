Look No Further! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by eternalotis The Sunlights demonstrate on this record what it's all about. Subtract the drums, the bass, the piano and everything except their five voices and you get a purity of blend and intention in gospel quartet singing that I have rarely, if ever, heard captured on tape. Beautifully recorded, this record recalls the best of the Southern gospel quartet tradition. Tracks to check out: \"Somewhere To Lay My Head\", \"Roll Jordan\", \"Gotta Find My Way\". One of the finest and truest gospel records I've ever heard. Thank God for Flying Fish Records in Chicago who originally put it out!
