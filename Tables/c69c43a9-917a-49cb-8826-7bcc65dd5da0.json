For the most part, though, this gifted 23-year-old is more concerned with thwarted dreams, lost love, and wounded idealism than protest balladry. Echoes of Neil Young, Tom Waits, and Todd Snider can be heard in these tracks, seasoned with dashes of Memphis rockabilly and honky-tonk country. Fullbright sprinkles Biblical allusions in songs like \u201cGawd Above\u201d (a monologue by the deity set to a swampy groove), \u201cJericho\" (a plea for self-knowledge), and \u201cI Only Pray at Night\u201d (a stark, piano-centered confession). The swagger and sass of \u201cSatan and St. Paul\u201d and \u201cAll the Time in the World\u201d balance the downcast spirits of \u201cNowhere to Be Found\u201d and \u201cForgotten Flowers.\u201d Fullbright\u2019s earnest, twang-tempered vocals can sound sardonic (\u201cFat Man\u201d) or tender (\u201cSong for a Child\u201d) as the tune requires. His first song collection is impressively mature and well-realized, marking him as more than a young upstart from Woody\u2019s hometown.
