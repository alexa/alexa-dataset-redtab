The five songs are short, spare, heart-wrenching, and bedroom recorded. Doiron, never a slave to pitch, lets her voice wander as the emotion dictates, and when she clunks a note on guitar, she lets it be. \"Snowfalls in November,\" a sprightly, hopeful tune, is the highlight, but all five songs are solid. The only problem is that the songs start to sound a little samey after a bit. Luckily, there aren't enough songs here to really let that be a problem. The other band on the split single, Okkervil River, is an alt-country band in the vein of Wilco or Palace. Will Robison Sheff's wavering and sometimes over the top vocals preside over a swirling big top jammed with Wurlitzers, accordions, and loads of guitars. When the band keeps it all together, like on the sprawling \"He Passes Number Thirty-Three\" or the epic \"Blackest Coat\" (at least until Sheff starts bellowing), it is a very pleasant racket. When Sheff oversings like a backwoods Bocelli and the band saws monotonously away on \"Omie Wise\" or Sheff's lyrics are squirmy like on \"A Leaf,\" the band should change its name to Overkill River. A very uneven release for them. And in fact, a very uneven split single as the stark intimacy of Doiron's songs and the jam-packed and barely under control songs by Okkervil River don't really blend at all., 121729=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
