Jon Butcher personally essays, the tales behind each tune found in the eight-page booklet brimming with photos and rich in band history. As the music crosses decades, Butcher cleverly splashes some of his favorite phrasings throughout the melodies and production, making it very, very appealing. \"The Tiger in the Tall Grass\" borrows heavily from early Rod Stewart/Faces, Beatles backing vocals, and, most notably, Paul McCartney's \"That Would Be Something\" from his first solo album. \"Wicked Woman\" (the title of a Janis Joplin bootleg, a fact that couldn't have escaped Butcher's notice) adds some culture shock from what precedes it \u2014 the kind of polished '80s rock that Bon Jovi's \"Livin' on a Prayer\" provided, only this Jon plays it so cool, slipping in a bit of \"Purple Haze\" into the mix. And speaking of such things, \"Red House\" is a standout. This artist has certainly come up with enough diverse sounds to separate him from his major influence \u2014 but when he dives into Hendrix territory, it is with true understanding and wild abandon. Jimi's friend Buzzy Linhart heard this version of \"Red House\" and noted that the tune has become the \"Stormy Monday Blues\"", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
