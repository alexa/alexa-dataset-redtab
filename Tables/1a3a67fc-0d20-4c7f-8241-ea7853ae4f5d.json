All rights reserved., 20067=Named after a PJ Harvey album and featuring Leisha Hailey (who was cast as Alice Pieszecki on Showtime\u2019s The L Word) and Camilla Grey (who performed with the notable Mellowdrone), Uh Huh Her is a refreshing synth duo with a true gift for writing catchy tunes that bounce around the dance floor. The sonic sheen of the opener, \u201cMarstorm,\u201d creates genuine enthusiasm that\u2019s hard to ignore, but it\u2019s the vocals\u2019 genuine warmth that makes the song stick. It\u2019s like that throughout Nocturnes, which isn\u2019t nearly as dark and foreboding as its title suggests; these are relatively bright and perky tracks. \u201cAnother Case,\u201d \u201cDisdain,\u201d and \u201cSame High\u201d pulse with that modern-yet-\u201880s groove that permeates pop fashion in 2011.
