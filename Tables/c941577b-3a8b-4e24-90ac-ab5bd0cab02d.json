The thing that stands out the most here is the noticeable reduction in the screamed vocals, maturing the band from a screamo/rap hybrid into more of a typical club rap group. Rest assured, though, nothing has changed lyrically. Brokencyde are just as into smoking blunts, popping bottles, and sharing their late-night freaky tales as they\u2019ve ever been, so while the execution has changed, the content is still more or less the same as it has ever been. With songs like the hater-addressing \u201cU Mad Bro?,\u201d it\u2019s clear that the bandmembers aren\u2019t worried about making converts out of any of their naysayers, and instead are fine with making an album that\u2019s aimed at their hardcore fans. Given how much Brokencyde seem to thrive on people hating them, that's probably exactly the way they want it. Biography Formed: 2007 in Albuquerque, NM Genre: Pop Years Active: '00s, '10s Self-described \"scene\" kids from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Brokencyde (as in \"broke inside\") mix pop-rap, dance music, and some screamo vocals into a love-it-or-hate-it brew", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
