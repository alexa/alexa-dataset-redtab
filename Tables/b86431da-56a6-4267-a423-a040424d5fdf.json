Gareth McGrillen and Rob Swire, formerly of the drum and bass act Pendulum, come out swinging on Rage Valley, Knife Party's aptly titled second EP (and its first for Warner Bros.). If the bass wobbled any lower on the aggressive opening title track, it'd only be audible to dogs and large mammals. But the duo cleverly dodges one-trick-pony novelties by mixing in '80s-toned synths and Italian-flavored disco flourishes before dropping funny Nature Channel samples into the start of \u201cCentipede.\u201d With an earth-shaking low end, this number is the EP\u2019s gem. It sparkles and glows with neon keyboards while dropping a bottom that could rattle the fillings from your teeth if played through high-end German speakers. \u201cBonfire\u201d gets summery with a buoyant reggae bounce while recalling the group's prior penchant for jungle rhythms. And yes, Knife Party maintains its seismic bass on this one, as well as on the closing \u201cSleaze,\u201d which grooves on a foreboding melody akin to the Jaws theme.
