There's a definite California feel to the quartet's sound (they are from San Francisco after all), though the guys use their time to address various sources of societal aggravation instead of merely days passed skating with friends. Enemy You is as disillusioned as the next band, but frontman David Jones articulates his frustrations in such a direct and concise manner (coupled with his fierce and unwavering delivery) that songs come off more empowered and defiant than just angst-ridden or whiny. Especially coupled with the minimal production, songs like \"We Are the Ones\" and \"Plastic\" evoke images of '90s acts like Lagwagon or, at times, an Ignition-era Offspring, while \"Promise Breakers\" delve into Pennywise terrain with its forceful backing vocal harmonies (which turn up throughout the album). With most songs hovering around the two-minute mark and many barely even making that, the band proves that 24 minutes is really all the time one needs to make an impression. Stories Never Told is a definite throwback to the days when Epitaph and Fat Wreck reigned supreme. Miss those days? Enemy You is here with vigor to take you back.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
