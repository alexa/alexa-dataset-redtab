I can't help but wonder if any similarities are coincidental, or if a hardware designer was having a little fun ... Hard to say. My guess is an engineer might've snuck some aspects in and hoped nobody from legal/patents/copyright/etc noticed. I've seen all of those design pieces on web cams. The tri-pod legging to let it stand on its own or on top of a monitor. The shape of the thing itself isn't exactly that odd... you normally see more round but there's nothing odd there. And the lense probably only looks red/purple from certain angles, as I've seen on other lenses. Or perhaps it's just a dirty/oily lense.
