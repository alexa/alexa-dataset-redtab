That is why I have a bias to this baptism, for that reason only. My son-in-law is a baptist and I get surprised why the baptists are against baptising a child. If he must do that consciensiously he can perform a chrismation when he grows up. He should not be denied the blessings of baptism when he is young because no one can guarantee life.
