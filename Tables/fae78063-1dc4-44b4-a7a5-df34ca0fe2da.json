Opening the iTunes", "textAfterTable": "13 Items Album Review Released less than two years after Adelphia, Identity on Fire offers more of the familiar A Skylit Drive formula: emotional, weighty alt-rock anthems punctuated by guttural growls, screams, electronics, and the occasional synthesizer. Like many screamo bands, A Skylit Drive put most of their energy into making volatile (but melodic) music, saving Brian White\u2019s screams for key moments and giving most of the spotlight to lead vocalist Michael Jagmin. Much has been made of Jagmin\u2019s similarity to Geddy Lee, and these 12 songs do little to dispel that connection. He sings in an impossibly high register, with a touch of nasality and drama-kid theatricality adding some color to the melodies. The other bandmates don\u2019t take such unique approaches to their own instruments, but they do know how to keep things varied, whether they\u2019re launching into half-time during a bridge or sprinkling some dark, atmospheric electronica into an otherwise straightforward rock song. At times, the guys resemble a rap-free Linkin Park; elsewhere, they\u2019re indistinguishable from millennial metalcore acts like We Came as Romans. A Skylit Drive have a rare frontman in Michael Jagmin, though, and they\u2019d do well to stretch more boundaries on their future albums.
