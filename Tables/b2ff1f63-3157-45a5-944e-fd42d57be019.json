Nashville folk duo The Civil Wars have been all over this great country since releasing their debut album, Barton Hallow. The result is that their brand of Americana sounds more open, more assured on their self-titled follow-up. Singer Joy Williams has an impressive set of pipes, one she unleashes at will, but she seems to having more fun here on songs like \u201cOh Henry,\u201d while John Paul White lets loose, too, with some electric guitar. The duo makes Smashing Pumpkins\u2019 \u201cDisarm\u201d even more confessional and dirge-like, as first premiered on their Live at Amoeba release. Fans don\u2019t have to worry, though, that they\u2019ve forgotten their roots or gone the way of Mumford & Sons-style bombast. Even with production from Rick Rubin, \u201cI Had Me a Girl\u201d sounds like a old Western blues \u2014 it just hits harder than anything they\u2019ve done before, with extra cowboy-booted kick. \u201cThe One That Got Away\u201d is some of the duo\u2019s finest work yet, moody and rocky, with some production and songwriting from Charlie Peacock. But even with these collaborators, Williams and White know what makes them work is their particular chemistry, and The Civil Wars often still sounds like the work of two people alone in a room creating", "textAfterTable": "Side B Titles Artist Length 1.
