I had the pleasure of working with Garth, in Antarctica of all places, and have loved this album since. It's a trip, a voyage, and a different one every time I listen. A great album, from an exceptionally gifted and kind man. The film we did, creeping out this year, is called The Red Knot, and scored by Garth. I can't wait to hear what he's done with it. Lean back, relax, close your eyes, and enjoy Alpine in the meanwhile. Bon voyage ;) Biography Genre:", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
