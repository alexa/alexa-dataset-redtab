In the late '80s I was obsessed with only a couple of bands. They were The Cure, Depeche Mode, Siouxsie & The Banshees, New Order, The Pet Shop Boys, The Smiths and Erasure. I think I had discovered Erasure around their second album, The Circus, in 1987. They just seemed to be getting better and better as the years went on. They released The Innocents in 1988 which featured \"A Little Respect\" and \"Chains Of Love.\" Then they put out Wild! in 1989 which featured \"Star\" and \"Blue Savannah.\" Chorus was their fifth album and their last truly great album. It featured \"Chorus,\" \"Breathe Of Life\" and \"Love To Hate You.\" I\u00a0had really like Wild! so I was very excited for this album to come out in 1991. It was released in October of 1991, a month after Nevermind by Nirvana. It couldn't be more different than\u00a0Nevermind, but somehow I loved both of these albums equally.\u00a0I am sure there were many days when I listened to both Nevermind and Chorus on the same day. Erasure really helped create the whole dance pop sound that influenced tons of bands over the years. I am not sure if we should thank them or not for that.\u00a0But they did manage to create some brilliant pop songs over the years. Erasure was Andy Bell and Vince Clark. Vince Clark managed to help create three of my favorite bands: Depeche Mode, then Yaz, and finally Erasure. Every once in a while I go back and listen to this album and quickly remember why I fell in love with it in the first place. It is just a perfect album of its genre. Erasure was never able to create an album this consistently perfect ever again. But they sure did create some catchy songs and they have made a lot of us very happy over the years., 353=This album featured in Brad\u2019s Best Albums of 1991 blog., 2684=Brad 10/15/2012}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{10207=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Amoeba, All Rights Reserved.
