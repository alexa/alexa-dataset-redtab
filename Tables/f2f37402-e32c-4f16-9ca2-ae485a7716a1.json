First there is the raid, but then they say it was only a dead PDU and that TPB is no longer hosted on that service. The question remains however, was the raids target supposed to be TPB or was it all a coincidence? I am certainly getting tired of this shit. They have no hope of stopping it and apparently if they don't get their way they are willing to burn it all down. That should be grounds for execution, or at the least, litigation into the financial grave. The internet was NOT created so for the business world, it was created for the people. At least, that is how I like to think of it, and it is true beyond any similar thing in the history of mankind. I wish they would stop trying to get rich off of it. So many wonderful things we could have were it not for bullshit laws and the corporations that buy them thanks to corrupted governments. First of all the internet has grown far beyond what it was originally capable of and its intended purpose. It started its life as private military network (ARPANET) and networks between universities.
