These years include most of the artist's most important output, particularly dancefloor hits like \"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real),\" \"Dance (Disco Heat),\" and \"Body Strong.\" In addition to these stellar dance tracks, songs like \"Cry Me a River\" and a live version of \"You are My Friend\" emphasize Sylvester's warmth and soulfulness. The album is shorter and less comprehensive than Fantasy's earlier Greatest Hits compilation, but all the same offers a good and, since it's one CD rather than two, likely more affordable introduction to one of the most exciting and energetic figures of the disco era., 125605=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
