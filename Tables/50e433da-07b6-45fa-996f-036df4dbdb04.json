The 11 minutes of \u201cKissing the Beehive\u201d begins conventionally enough before sprawling out as the album\u2019s obvious closer, while the six minutes of \u201cCalifornia Dreamer\u201d tightens the reins ever so slightly, bouncing in exultant glee with shattering guitar chords and elliptical keyboard figures until the chaos settles into songform. There\u2019s a carnivalesque, Brit pop bounce that sends the band on its way, suggesting what the Fratellis might sound like if they weren\u2019t so darned Scottish. \u201cThe Grey Estates\u201d and \u201cSoldier\u2019s Grin\u201d pump excitedly with an exaggerated sense of personal fulfillment, a luminous overconfidence that swaggers past to hide their nervous tics. \u201cFine Young Cannibals\u201d does not in any way recall the band of the same name, but emits from the blurry David Bowie era of Diamond Dogs with its glam pedigree nicely updated.\u00a0 Customer Reviews Amazing \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Neutral Milk Hotel I've been a fan of Spencer Krug", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
