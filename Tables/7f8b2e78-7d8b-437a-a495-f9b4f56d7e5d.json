The original show contains many album tracks and very interesting discussion on the background of the recording sessions and Ornette specifically. This is a tape (two actually) that I've been carrying around for sometime waiting for the right opportunity. There is no better time than in celebration of Ornette's 80th birthday to do this. A full album side of classic comedy from Mr Ed the Talking Horse, and the story of Ed The Song Writer March is Women's History Month so we play a set from Mary Lou Williams, the first woman in Jazz. Live piano quartet from Ronnie Scotts in London from 1954 Getting prepared for St. Patricks Day next week we share a recipe for good 'ol Corned Beef and Cabbage. Real easy and delicious! Join us again next Friday 11am to 1pm for another helping of Lunchtime. Next week will be a very special radiothon edition!!!
