You can access the config menu by right-clicking the block. It does pretty much what Broker Factions does with the following additions: - Can represent the watched faction with an ASCII bar. - Can sort by reputation level (thx to Neorgia) - Can watch hidden factions. - Colors are editable. It has been designed with efficiency in mind: fast and lightweight, yet feature full. Click a header (white entry) to expand or collapse. Click a faction to \"watch\" it. (Alliance Vaguard and Horde Expedition are special cases and require a shift+click to be watched.) Middle-Click a faction to move it to actives/inactives. Right-Click a faction to copy its info in chatbox. Collapsed headers are saved across session (with the exception of inactive factions that are automatically collapsed by Blizzard at login). This plugin supports AddonLoader (delayed loading), Skinner and SharedMedia (limited).
