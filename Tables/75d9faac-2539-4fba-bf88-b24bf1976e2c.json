ScintillaEdit A more complete C++ widget with a method for every Scintilla API and a secondary API allowing direct access to document objects. ScintillaEditPy A Python callable version of ScintillaEdit using the PySide bindings. Building a library ScintillaEditBase can be built without performing any generation steps. The ScintillaEditBase/ScintillaEditBase.pro project can be loaded into Qt Creator and the \"Build All\" command performed. Alternatively, run \"qmake\" to build make files and then use the platform make to build. Most commonly, use \"make\" on Unix and \"nmake\" on Windows. ScintillaEdit requires a generation command be run first. From the ScintillaEdit directory: python WidgetGen.py After the generation command has run, the ScintillaEdit.h and ScintillaEdit.cpp files will have been populated with the Scintilla API methods. To build, use Qt Creator or qmake and make as for ScintillaEditBase. ScintillaEditPy is more complex and instructions are found in ScintillaEditPy/README.
