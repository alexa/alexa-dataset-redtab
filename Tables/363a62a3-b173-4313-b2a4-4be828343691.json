His eldest son became king but was removed from his duties in 1952 due to mental illness. In 1953, his teenage son Hussein Ibn Talal became king, and continued to rule for over 40 years. In the 1960s, Jordan saw many immigrants arrive and settle \u2013 mainly Palestinians escaping the conflict in their homeland. In 1999, King Abdullah II succeeded his father King Hussein and continues to rule Jordan now. His reign has been characterised by liberal policies, economic reforms and technological advances. His wife, Queen Rania of Jordan, has a visible public profile, is active in many social causes and is regarded internationally as a highly influential woman., 60059=The weather in Jordan can get quite extreme. Overall, it tends to be hot during the day and cold at night (in desert areas, expect it to be extremely hot during the day and freezing at night). Yet during winter it can get bitterly cold, with snowfall occurring in some parts of the country. Travelling during the summer months (June, July and August) can be challenging for those not accustomed to the heat, so visiting Jordan during spring and autumn is recommended for those who wish to escape the hotter temperatures.

If you are planning to travel during Ramadan, it's important to consider that many restaurants and shops will either be closed or operating on reduced hours during this time.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading 10.
