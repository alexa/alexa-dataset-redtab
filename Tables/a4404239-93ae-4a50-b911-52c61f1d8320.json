Tackling such famous songs as \"On the Street Where You Live\" from My Fair Lady, \"Some People\" from Gypsy, \"Edelweiss\" from The Sound of Music, and \"I'll Be Seeing You\" from Right This Way, Eder puts her own spin on some of her favorites while retaining the emotional draw that made them popular in the first place. A rather eclectic set, one might question why Eder would choose two songs from the same musical (Man of La Mancha) and one (\"Gold\") from a show that is still in the works (not to mention that it was the title song from her previous release), when there are so many other selections that her fans, no doubt, would love to hear her cover. Also troublesome is that two recordings (\"Man of La Mancha\" and \"Unusual Way\" from Nine) were taken from Eder's 1997 release, It's Time, causing the listener to wonder if time restraints created the need to duplicate, or if these songs are so close to Eder's heart that she felt compelled to include them on this collection. Either way, it really doesn't matter. As the album title states, this is Eder's Broadway, and style and substance make up for any false steps on this outing. A timeless talent that will far outlive many of those taking the undeserved spotlight on the Top 40 charts., 129568=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
