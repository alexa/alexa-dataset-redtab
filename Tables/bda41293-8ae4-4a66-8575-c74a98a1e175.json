He contacted Universal about this soundtrack and Battlestar Galactica: Razor/The Plan. As of January 3, 2011 here it is. Favorite Tracks: 1) Are you alive?/Battlestar Galactica Theme, 2) Goodbye baby, 4) Kiss or not to kiss, 19) Thousands Left Behind, 20) Silica Pathways and 24) Battle. I felt since Richards Gibbs started with The Mini-Series his work need to be included too. Between both Richard and Bear I have never owned a TV Show Soundtrack before it's usually movies and video-games. Then I can listen to this all the time and that's truly saying how good their work is.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 03:33:39 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Open iTunes to preview, buy, and download music.

And as a side note, they posted this on the same day as they did the soundtrack from Razor and The Plan. Are You Alive? and The Storm and the Dead alone make this a great album and at $9.99, you can't go wrong for getting the whole album.

I don't feel this was quite as strong as most of Bear McCreary's work on the series. There are a few standouts though. Are You Alive?/Main Title is very good, and I just love the move from the \"Six\"", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
