This Los Angeles combo takes the doom and paranoia of classic metal, and stretches them out into kaleidoscopically unfolding experimental jams, with technical but soulful drumming, clean, melodic vocal harmonies and ever-ascending guitar lines. After a stunning debut LP and then a couple of impressive but stilted followups, Habitual Levitations is Intronaut's ass-kicking masterpiece, an album to which you can headbang, work out some equations in fractal geometry, or swim through a river of purple clouds. They are about to commence a tour with the extremely mathtastic Animals As Leaders and the legendarily brutal Meshuggah, which will surely be a summer must-see for true heads.
