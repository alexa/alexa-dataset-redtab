The self-produced Outside features a wide spectrum of styles that sharply highlight the band\u2019s multiple personalities and charms. There\u2019s much to enjoy here including standouts \u201cBadaboom,\u201d with its ramshackle rhythm pattern, the infectious guitar hook that anchors \u201cOne In the World,\u201d the stuttering, slithering \u201cOutro,\u201d and the rollicking \u201cFreak Out.\u201d Elsewhere they drop the tempo, if not the dynamics, for \u201cThe Saddest of All Keys\u201d and \u201cHidee Ho,\u201d both of which stand apart among the jagged, jittery pop of much of the album, while \u201cOn and On\u201d builds and releases before devolving into some glorious noise. Tight and punchy one moment, loose and jangly the next, Outside succeeds by playing on the band\u2019s well honed strengths.
