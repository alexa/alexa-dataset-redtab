Oneohtrix Point Never) makes dubby-sounding, synth-heavy ambient pop that\u2019s both inventive and highly accessible. Replica topped many forward-thinking critics\u2019 lists for 2011's best music. The first track, \u201cAndro,\u201d is so lush and pretty that it makes for some of the most blissed-out ambient sounds you\u2019ve heard since the heyday of shoegaze in the early '90s. Like much of the record, it\u2019s also unexpectedly varied, understatedly switching gears when you least expect it. It might be ideal to listen to the album without knowing that the entire thing (spoiler alert) is \"an electronic song cycle based around lo-fi audio procured from television advertisement compilations,\" according to his label. If you listen closely, you can hear the swirls of text from old commercials. But it\u2019s fine to just give in and let these looping, smeared sounds envelop you. Customer Reviews Score: 9.2/10 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by llkkjj A very experimental and glitchy record. There have not been very many ambient releases that can live up to this ones standards, it is refreshing to hear this. It is very strong all the way through,", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
