All rights reserved., 21033=The solo debut from Holsapple, co-leader of North Carolina power-popsters the dB's, was released in 1997, and it seemed to vanish from circulation almost as soon as it hit the racks. And that's a shame, because it meant the world was robbed of the chance of hearing one of pop's finest craftsmen at his most stripped-down and honest. Recorded with friends in a New Orleans studio in the early 1990s, \"Out of My Way's\" 11 tracks run from the rollicking, full-band peformances \"I Been There,\" and \"Meet Me In The Middle,\" to the gentle, solo acoustics of \"Pretty, Damned, Smart,\" and \"I Am A Tree.\" Throughout, Holsapple's knowing way with a hook and keen melodic sense provide strong underpinnings to the tunes. And it's always mystified this reviewer why Holsapple's work, both with the dB's and on his own, never seemed to reach the wider audience that it deserved. Holsapple recently reacquired rights to the LP after a decade of it floating in limbo and chose to re-release it in this digital-only format. Take advantage of the opportunity. It's rare that a songwriter provides such an intimate glance behind the curtain. -- John L.
