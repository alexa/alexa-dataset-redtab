Welcome to Pat Lewis-lite. The title misleads with wording normally used for greatest-hits compilations. These weren't hits, simply part of a mega-project by Ian Levine to record everybody connected with Motown. And it sounds like it \u2014 you'd think Lewis grew up in suburbia in a house with multi-bathrooms and a bedroom big enough to hang a bicycle on the wall rather than rough and tumble Detroit, MI. The whole affair is as creative as StarTac's nine irritating phone ring choices. Remakes of Jackie Ross' \"Selfish One\" and Tammi Terrell's \"Come on and See Me\" are the most arresting; on both she mimics the original singer's style. Lewis' most intense vocal comes on a remake of Fontella Bass' \"Rescue Me,\" but the track is sterile compared to the fiery original. Best of the rest are \"The Rhythm Is Right,\" \"Talk to Me,\" and the beat ballad \"Sweetest Feeling.\" Top Albums and Songs by Pat Lewis", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
