Her simple folk melodies and beautiful vocals are reminiscent of the early \u201860s in their purity and lack of artifice. There is an elemental joy to \u201cMy Baby Lives In Paris\u201d that elicits feelings of first love and of springtime. There\u2019s a Spanish undertow to many tracks including the lilting opener, \u201cParaty\u201d and Violetta Parra\u2019s \u201cGracias a la Vida\u201d that easily transcends language. Baden Powell\u2019s \u201cCanto de lemanja\u201d features beautifully multi-tracked vocals that accentuate the uneasy feeling of the sparse percussion. Latin percussion further emphasizes the beauty of \u201cUnder the Sun,\u201d a cut that sounds as if it was unearthed from a Los Angeles recording studio in the early 1970s. Fans of Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins and Joan Baez will surely thrill to this unpretentious sound. Todd is classically trained and unashamed to use her knowledge. It\u2019s a pity there aren\u2019t more like her. But then refined talent is always at a premium.
