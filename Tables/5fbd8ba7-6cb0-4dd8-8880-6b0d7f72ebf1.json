Not sure how i discovered them but i'm glad i did, There vocalist, Cory is extremely nice, he responds to everything i send to him, the rest of the band also responds to most if not all posts on there facebook page. They know what they are doing musically, and i expect them to become a band like asking alexandria in the next few years, they definitely have the potential.
