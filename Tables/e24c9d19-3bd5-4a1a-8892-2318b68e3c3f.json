I want to use one sb600 in my lastolite ezybox and one as a fill light elsewhere. I want to use the strobes in manual mode but can't figure out how to adjust the power output on the individual units without changing the power of the whole system. Have I just been stupid and left it on TTL? I will be using this for weddings in mostly low light situations... With gels occasionally too Thanks for your infinite patience guys!

Set them to manual on the D700. Then on the d700 you should be able to set their outputs to different levels. As long as they are both set the same channel they will both fire; the different groups will fire at whatever output rates you set them to... At least that is how I do it on my D200...
