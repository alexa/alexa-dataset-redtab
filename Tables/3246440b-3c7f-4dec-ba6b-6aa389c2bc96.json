Clean Icons - Thin, by Suicidalkatt - Removed icon .blp's which were in the Interface folder to reduce file download size. I HIGHLY recommend: 01/09 -Release.1 - TinyDPS border fixed, now 1px. - Shapeshift bar moved above player frame. - Entire UI moved inward by 4 pixels. Added m_Buffs to cover player buffs/debuffs (I'd still like to have debuffs shown over player frame, but having parenting issues). - Cascade should now parent to the minimap (if it doesn't try removing the SavedVariables for this AddOn). - TipTac replaced with FreebTip - NibRunes removed, replaced with a modified guRunes - looks REALLY slick, fantastic run animation! - NibEclipse removed, oUF_NIN covers", "textAfterTable": "Comment Options Page 12 of 57 \u00ab First < 2 10 11 12 13 14 22 > Last \u00bb 03-09-12, 09:58 AM", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
