It's from a few years ago, but it's so catchy and a good dance song. The vocals are great in this song, Risako Sugaya, Momoko Tsugunaga, Miyabi Nastuyaki, and Yurina Kumai have the main vocals in this song, but everyone sounds fantastic! I totally think you should buy this song, it has a great beat and kawaii members. Check out the awesome video too! ^_^ Wow!!! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Giraffesman Finally its back!!! Also isn't it Special Generation and not Suppecial Generation? Either way GREAT Berryz song!
