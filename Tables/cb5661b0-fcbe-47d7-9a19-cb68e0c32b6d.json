Baltimore duo Wye Oak have been at it for a few years, producing great albums like 2011\u2019s Civilian, but touring for that album left the band exhausted, and they were living in different cities. With new synthesizers in the place of guitars and drums, Wye Oak\u2019s sound is reimagined on the stunning Shriek. Jenn Wasner sounds revelatory on opener \u201cBefore,\u201d singing over dreamy synth washes and retro computer loops. Every instrument seems to occupy its own perfect space on the title track, creating a lovely little syncopated groove, while Wasner sings beautifully with high-flying abandon. That gorgeous opening makes way for Wye Oak to experiment a bit. \u201cTower\u201d sees the band employing an R&B-inspired, stuttering groove, drawing influence from the spacey krautrock of Can as well as Timbaland and Missy Elliott\u2019s work with Aaliyah. The changes sound so thrilling because Wye Oak clearly thrive in their new territory, moving freely through the sexy, Fleetwood Mac-inspired \u201cGlory,\u201d in which they sound like wise, older siblings to recent pop group Haim. And in the album\u2019s loungier second half, the band produces robotic, poolside glamour (\u201cDespicable Animal\u201d); intricate, jungly noise (\u201cParadise\u201d) and lush, adult pop (\u201cLogic of Color\u201d). Playing new wave sophisticates suits Wye Oak quite well, giving them new life with brilliant results. 04/28/2014 Amoeba Review", "textAfterTable": "Side B Titles Artist Length 1.
