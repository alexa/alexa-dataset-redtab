I thought that it needed a background, and this shade of orange, I thought, worked well. Looking at it afterward made me think of \"Van Gogh\", though, which I suppose isn't so terrible.", "Ness falling into Magicant.", "I'd debated for a while on how to tackle the Soul-Consuming Flame, and finally decided on fewer flames and sort of inner glow. I was thinking of actual images I'd seen before of lava flows, with flames poking up at their surface. Once I'd finished the character itself though, I knew it needed SOME sort of background. I started out with the floor, which I wanted to have a dry, cracked look. I started out haphazardly not expecting much, but like the effect that I was able to get with what I did. Above him, I tried depicting a smokey, dark Fire Springs.", "Manly Fish, with a harpoon/ spear of sorts. This one was all about goofing around and experimenting with shades of green to give the Manly Fish some texture. I didn't pull off a \"scaly\" look as much as I'd been hoping, but I think it sort of emulates markings on some fish, like a speckled trout a bit, which I figured to be kinda cool. I also liked the idea of making his arms into prehensile fins.", "\"Help!\" Mr. Molecule is one of those enemies that just about anyone could draw, due to its simplicity. I wanted to draw him too, but do something different. I thought about trying to assemble a large, compound mollectule out of Mr. Mollecules but decided against it, figuring it'd be better suited at a 3D artist. So I decided on a regular formation of Mr. Mollecules, to form a magnified bit of crystal. I made the \"atom\" balls a bit on the blurry side to illustrate the \"whirlingness\" of their electrons. ;P"], ["Date", "4/27/05", "4/27/05", "4/27/05", "4/27/05", "4/27/05"], ["Rank", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00"]], "pageTitle": "STARMEN.NET - EarthBound / Mother 3 Goodness.", "title": "", "url": "http://starmen.net/vote/vote.php?id=11157&stuff=DateDESC&stuffPageNumber=97", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988061.16/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00008-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 223964791, "recordOffset": 223956589, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "textBeforeTable": "> 1 < Other Submissions by ozwalled The Big Bad.
