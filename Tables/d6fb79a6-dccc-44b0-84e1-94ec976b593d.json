Chadbourne released a torrent of homemade solo LPs and handmade cassettes out of his Greensboro North Carolina home. Kramer went on to form Bongwater with performance artist and Goddess Ann Magnuson and rise to prominence as a producer. David Licht briefly played skins in Bongwater, while also joining such bands as B.A.L.L., When People Were Shorter And Lived Near The Water and The Klezmatics., 137691=Latest newsletter: May 2015, 146114=Copyright \u00a9 2012 KBOO Community Radio | Copyright Policy | Community Guidelines | Website Illustration & Design by: KMF ILLUSTRATION, 110745=Fall Membership Drive:\u00a0Autumnal October songs, Local Artists, 122834=They recorded their first EP on Halloween of 1982. It was a weirdly disjointed collection of covers of rockabilly, garage punk, country songs, with a Beatles cover thrown in for good measure. All songs would shift in tempo, style and not too infrequently fall apart under a fuzzy haze of intense guitar freakout. This seems to have established the M.O. for subsequent albums by them. Shockabilly would run cherished music from the Sixties Billboard charts through their crazed blender, rendering a Hendrix song into a bluegrass breakdown, a Roger Miller song into a demented opera. Occasional originals were often paeans to bad trips or psychedelic ephemera. Shockabilly sounded like the weird little transitional bits in the margins of Mothers of Invention albums or perhaps like an old radio that would shift frequencies suddenly and without warning., 125219=Sadly, Eugene Chadbourne claims Shockabilly was one of his least favorite projects and Kramer has apparently desecrated the mixes on subsequent reissues of the Shockabilly catalog he released on his Shimmy-Disc label. The 2008 remixes seem to have addressed this somewhat.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 04:46:33 +0000", "textBeforeTable": "10/10/2010 Air date:\u00a0 Higher Reasoning Reggae Time Program name:\u00a0 Higher Reasoning Reggae Time playlist for 10/10/2010 view full schedule To be determined 10:00pm-12:00am One Two, One Two Mobile Support Archives Listen Schedule Programs \u00a0 Audio Options Listen Now!
