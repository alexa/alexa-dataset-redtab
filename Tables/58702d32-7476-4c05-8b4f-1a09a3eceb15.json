The somewhat somber glory of 2010's One Life Stand, however, can still be heard in spots. \"Look at Where We Are\" works over a wistful texture with an Alexis Taylor falsetto that's pure R&B. \"These Chains\" revolves on an '80s synth-pop platform that recalls the romance of Duran Duran and New Order with a rich melody that's subtly inescapable. But the band hasn't forgotten the needs of the dance floor. The seven-minute \"Flutes\" builds slowly and carefully to a satisfying climax that calls up a striking melody to match the propulsive beats. \"Motion Sickness\" has a relentless but luxurious groove that's filled with sweet points of light and elliptical keyboard riffs. \"How Do You Do?\" works playfully with a mechanized, hypnotic bass line underneath the synth patches. Disco, techno, and synth-pop coalesce in unpredictable patterns to create music that's innovative yet still comforting and familiar.
