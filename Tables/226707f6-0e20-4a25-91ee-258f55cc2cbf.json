After a little bit of fun and frivolity, we finished some past buisness by playing the remainder of Madison Square Garden 09-09-91 SBD. At this point, we aired a beautiful \"Killer Audience Tape\" of The Jerry Garcia Band at The Orpheum Theater in Boston Ma. 12-02-77 Early Show. This has always been a favorite of mine. I was given a cassette copy of a bootleg album called \"The Grateful Dead Featuring Jerry Garcia Boston Ma. 12-02-77. (Bootleg albums were famous for not getting it right). This was a fine performance of a very up show! Content worthy of playing for everyone in the family! We were joined about midway through the program by Scotty Gillan from The Jerry Garcia Birthday Band to talk about Jerry's Birthday at The McMenamens Edgefield. This is where the J.G.B.B. got it's start, playing sets every year on Jerry's Birthday. Boy! What a fabulous weekend for DeadHeads! Saturday night at the Tonic Lounge, Tom Wright brought his Garcia cover\u00a0band \"Cats Down Under The Stars\" in for a Jerry Garcia Band hoedown!\u00a0(Tom also fronts \"Ramblin' Rose\",\u00a0the\u00a0Grateful Dead cover band). And then the Garcia Birthday thing at The Edgefield! (With The Freak Mountain Ramblers putting the cap on a perfect day!). Tom Chiles is taking a little time off to get some things taken care of, and we hope he will be back very soon! I'll be on the air again August 28th.

Cabaret Voltaire formed in 1973, around Richard H. Kirk, Stephen Mallinder and Chris Watson. Initially utilizing minimal electronics and tape to make their highly original sounds, they eventually incorporated Funk, dance and Dub in the mix and released numerous singles, EPs and albums. Watson left the group in the early 80\u2032s to pursue a career in television and has since gained acclaim as an environmental sound recordist. Cabaret Voltaire\u2019s output slowed to a crawl in the Nineties and there has yet to be a proper CV recording in this century. Richard H. Kirk continues to put out releases under his own name, as Sandoz, Biochemical Dread and more. He has lately said in interviews that the last three or four Cabaret Voltaire albums were the work of himself alone., 69563=Artist-Title-Album (Label, year recorded) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Voice of America \u2013 Voice of America (Rough Trade, \u201980) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Do the Mussolini Headkick \u2013 Living Legends (Mute, \u201978) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Baader/Meinhof \u2013 Original Sounds of Sheffield (Mute, \u201978) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 The Dada Man \u2013 1974-1976 (Industrial Records \u201978) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 No Escape \u2013 Original Sounds of Sheffield (Mute, \u201978) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Nag Nag Nag \u2013 Living Legends (Mute, \u201978) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Do the Snake \u2013 1974-1976 (Industrial Records \u201978) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Seconds Too Late \u2013 Living Legends (Mute, \u201978) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 This is Entertainment \u2013 Voice of America (Rough Trade, \u201980) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 If Shadows Could March \u2013 Voice of America (Rough Trade, \u201980) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Stay Out Of It \u2013 Voice of America (Rough Trade, \u201980) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Red Mask \u2013 Red Mecca (Rough Trade, \u201981) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Split Second Feeling \u2013 Red Mecca (Rough Trade, \u201981) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Sluggin\u2019 Fer Jesus \u2013 Eight Crepescule Tracks (Interior Music, \u201987) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Yashar \u2013 2 X 45 (Rough Trade, \u201981) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Hallucination Sequence \u2013 Johnny Yesno OST (Doublevision, \u201983) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Do Right \u2013 Microphonies (Virgin, \u201984) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Sensoria \u2013 Sensoria 12\u2033 (Virgin/Some Bizarre, \u201984) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 I Want You \u2013 Arm of the Lord (Virgin/Some Bizarre, \u201985) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Hell\u2019s Home \u2013 Arm of the Lord (Virgin/Some Bizarre, \u201985) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 James Brown \u2013 James Brown 12\u2033 (Virgin/Some Bizarre, \u201985) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Shakedown \u2013 Drain Train (Doublevision, \u201986) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Taxi Mutant \u2013 International Language (Instinct, \u201992) Cabaret Voltaire \u2013 Soul Vine (70 Billion People) \u2013 Plasticity (Instinct, \u201993)}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 04:54:18 +0000", "textBeforeTable": "08/06/2010 Air date:\u00a0 Movin' On Program name:\u00a0 Movin' On playlist for 08/06/2010 view full schedule To be determined 10:00pm-12:00am One Two, One Two Mobile Support Archives Listen Schedule Programs \u00a0 Audio Options Listen Now!
