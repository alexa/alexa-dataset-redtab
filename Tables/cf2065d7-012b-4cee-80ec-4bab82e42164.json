With the panache and attitude of The Streets and the weirdo storytelling cues of Tom Waits, Quarrell seems to fit in perfectly with a lot of his contemporaries without really sounding like anyone else. Chintzy keyboard effects move songs like David Lynch-esque ballad \u201cOld Lovers\u201d along and give his hip-hop-style crooning a grimey taste in \"Say No to Thugs.\" Quarrell's lyrics and odd delivery keep Ex Tropical compelling throughout \u2014 \"get off the roof ... you'll go splat in the meadow\" he sings on \"Don't Litter\" while alien keyboard sounds surround him. Truthfully, Ex Tropical is better experienced first before I spoil everything special about it. Trust me; it'll knock your socks off.
