I am originally from Houston where line drying never produced any bad odors. When I moved to Oakland, California, I'd put my clothes out in the morning and take them in at the end of the day. They always had this horrible sour smell. So I bought a dryer. Problem solved. One of the locals clued me in a few years later that the secret was to get your clothes in before 3:00 in the afternoon! If you let the fog or the late afternoon/evening air hit your clothes, you might as well just toss them back in the washer and do it again., 42267=My bento blog: http://justbento.com/blog/1305 My art blog: http://jizaacaso.deviantart.com, 103369=I had a drier for 3 years and only ever used it once. That was when I had left my jeans over a dining chair to dry overnight and the waistband was still wet in the morning. I've lived in a flat with nowhere outside to dry clothes so bought clothes racks and airers for inside. I now live in a house with a garden so between April and October can dry clothes outside and indoors the rest of the time. Most clothes don't seem to be drier safe so I'd much rather air dry them and keep them looking nice. I do however, machine wash bras and delicates, hence why one of my 3 week old bras has the underwiring coming out. Learnt my lesson there!}", "lastModified": "Thu, 30 Jul 2015 04:07:18 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "New forum activity since your last visit More information about formatting options Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.
