Once we reach October I'll look at acquiring rice from the new crops., 17950=15lbs is 6.8kgs. Where I live a small bag is usually around half a kg (500g) so I'm guessing the same as Bronwyn, that you'll get through it within 6 or 7 months (when I was single 15lbs wold have lasted me around 3 months). If the rice is white and not brown (bran oils can go a bit rancid when stored over long periods) it's unlikely you'll notice much of a difference between the same rice now and how it tastes in September/October... although you might need a smidgen more water to cook it with then, then again, you may not notice this difference either., 18702=As neither my husband or I drive, and in order to save money, our backs and delivery costs, we've been buying rice in bulk lately. I bought two 10kg bags of rice in February (about 45lbs). From the looks of it we get through one of these every two months as we're just coming to the end of the second bag. I'll probably get three bags on my next order, so these should last us the same amount of time as your 15lb bag - my guess is that the rice we get will be from exactly the same batch as before, this means I'm expecting our rice to taste fine after 10 months - and that's on top of the time it took to get from the USA to the UK.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 03:33:04 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "New forum activity since your last visit More information about formatting options Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.
