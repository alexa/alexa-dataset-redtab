It has all the elements of what makes a classic mixtape solid. It's original, the beats are gritty and ear catching, and the vocals are purposely dulled - like in the tapes I would buy on the schoolyard from the kid with the dope music. \"The Biz\" brings me back to my childhood of mixtapes that were fresh from start to end. Biz Mixtape \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Dj Dopesack from Tampa I got this cd @ the Molemen's party Chicago Rocks from Astonish & Decay while at the merch booth with Panic. I didnt listen to it until I got on the plane home to Fla. By the time I got home this was 1 of my favorite mixtapes ever and Astonish took the title of 1 of Chicago's illest mc's.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
