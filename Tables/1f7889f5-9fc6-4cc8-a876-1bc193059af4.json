The album contains an overabundance of magical ideas, from the opening, unwinding drama of \u201cRound Here\u201d that suggests Springsteen at his most lyrical and theatrical, through the Band-Van Morrison jaunt of \u201cOmaha,\u201d the rollicking yet yearning \u201cMr. Jones\u201d and the moody life-or-death introspection of \u201cPerfect Blue Buildings,\u201d \u201cAnna Begins\u201d and \u201cSullivan Street.\u201d Customer Reviews Over and Over and Over and Over \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by CrickettPower I was living in Thailand when this album was released and it was one of the only cassettes I owned at the time....yes, I said cassettes. Anyway, I would listen to it constantly and on long trips to Malaysia for a new tourist visa, I would listen to it for hours at a time, over and over and over again. I NEVER got tired of it and to this day it is one of my favourite albums of all time - every song is worthy! For sure one of the 10th best 90's album !!!", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
