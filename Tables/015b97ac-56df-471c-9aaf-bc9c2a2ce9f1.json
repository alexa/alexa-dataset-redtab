Firstly, these are songs many of us have heard so many times that hearing them differently helps us re-appreciate them. Secondly, audiophiles and musicians get to hear these songs taken apart and stripped down a bit, unraveling some of the mystery. And finally, it\u2019s just more Led Zeppelin, something we could all use. Whereas some artists\u2019 outtakes could feel like filler, these alternate versions from one of the greatest albums even count as essential listening for fans.

That moment when Robert Plant pulls back and Jimmy Page lays harmonic notes over it and the whole band falls into complete lockstep is so exciting that it makes you feel happy to be alive when you hear it. John Bonham\u2019s rumbling beat and Plant\u2019s absolutely possessed vocals on \u201cFour Sticks\u201d are hypnotic, spiritual even.
