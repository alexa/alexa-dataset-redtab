This place is dedicated to the people who lost their lives in the genocide of 1994, and provides a peaceful space for survivors to mourn and ultimately heal., 10472=The original inhabitants of Rwanda, the Twa, lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle for centuries before the arrival of the Hutu people. Then the Tutsi brought with them a feudal system of land ownership and society. In 1890 Germany took control of Rwanda, and ruled until 1916 when the Belgians overpowered the German forces during World War I. Under Belgian rule, clashes between the Tutsi and the Hutu were frequent and a precursor to the violence of the 1990s. Independence was granted in 1962, and the Hutu majority came into power. Because of this, Tutsi people were marginalised, with less access to education and employment opportunities. This imbalance created simmering tensions within Rwanda, culminating in armed conflict and displacement of people., 11282=In 1994, Rwanda erupted into civil war following the death of the president in a plane crash (the plane was shot by a missile while trying to land in Kigali). Months of bloodshed ensued - it's estimated that close to a million people were killed within a period of 90 days. Millions of Rwandans fled into neighbouring Uganda and Tanzania to escape the violence, murder and looting that had taken over their country. Due to the loss of life and infrastructure caused by the genocide of 1994, many Rwandans today live in poverty. Despite this, Rwanda is currently rising out of hard times to move into the future with increased prosperity and improved living conditions. The economy is slowly improving due to a flourishing tourism industry and a new government that has invested in education and infrastructure., 949=Rwanda has a tropical highland climate, with temperatures being pleasantly warm most of the year. March to May is the wet season, so expect frequent rain and thunderstorms during this period, which can make trekking and other outdoor activities uncomfortable at times.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading 12.
