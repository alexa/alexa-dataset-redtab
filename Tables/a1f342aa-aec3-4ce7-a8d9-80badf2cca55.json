All of the village stores were local, no chains. We didn't have a deli or even pizza. We had to travel 16 miles to get to a Woolworth's and I can't even remember what was there. Rarely we would take the two hour train ride to NYC and go to Macy's. It was a different world. We did have a rich summer resort on one part of town but they had nowhere to spend their money either.
