But a number of factors make it somewhat disappointing, not the least of which is that Complete B-Sides is available only as a U.K. import due to U.S. licensing problems. That won't dissuade Pixies diehards from seeking it out, but many longtime fans probably already have these songs, either on the original singles or on the bootlegs that proliferated while 4AD inexplicably sat on them. At any rate, Complete B-Sides mostly delivers the goods, kicking off with a ferocious version of \"River Euphrates\" from the Gigantic single. Witty, spooky Doolittle B-sides like \"Manta Ray,\" \"Weird at My School,\" and \"Into the White\" are so good that it's a shame they weren't saved for Bossanova, when the band really could have used them. Meanwhile, the Neil Young cover \"Winterlong,\" which also appeared on The Bridge tribute, reaffirms the Pixies' ability to turn any artist's songs into their own. Not every song here scales these heights \u2014 \"Bailey's Walk\" and \"Dancing the Manta Ray\" are slightly less inspired bits of Doolittle-era pop perversity, and the snappy, strutting \"Santo\" and demented cow", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
