While \u201cBroken Homes\u201d has a new age, spacey quality to its whispery synths, its pitter-patter beats, gurgling synthesizer melodies and bits of sampled voice suggest something more humanistic, more emotional. \u201cLike a Ghost in Your Own Life\u201d ventures into a shuffling beat, while melodically it\u2019s still very much in Schnauss\u2019 wheelhouse of slowly shifting chords and kaleidoscopic arpeggios. The title track builds from familiar IDM touches and static chords to a gradually epic finish, with a more pronounced beat and light vocals appearing halfway through and sending the song skyward. \u201cI Take Comfort In Your Ignorance\u201d even shifts from its modal chords to an industrial sound halfway through. Without too dramatically changing his sound, Schnauss has found a way to make his gorgeous music sound even more evocative on A Long Way to Fall. 02/11/2013 Amoeba Review Vinyl LP Also available in: SHIPS FREE in U.S. $15.98 BUY", "textAfterTable": "BUY $15.98 SHIPS FREE in U.S. Also available in: LP User Reviews Overall Rating 0 Submissions RATE & REVIEW Who We Are Amoeblog Buy Sell Trade News & Contests Gift Certificates Contact Us Support & FAQ Sign-up for email news, sales alerts & more:", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
