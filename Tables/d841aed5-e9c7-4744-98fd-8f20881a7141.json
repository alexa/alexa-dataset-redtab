All rights reserved., 20427=Though Spooky Action At A Distance was indeed released during the throes of the springtime, the inherent sonic-space that each downward guitar stroke and bouncy, delay-ridden note reveals that this is a record that will endure any and all seasonal constrictions. It will soundtrack all things ephemeral from the snow, the sweat or the rustling leaves because Lockett Pundt (Lotus Plaza) has crafted an absolute triumph of an album that features the searing hooks of his more noted Rock-act (Deerhunter) and the prominance of his more-manic bandmate (Bradford Cox). Opening on a blooming sheet of ambience, \"Untitled\" recalls the titanic soundscapes of previous album, \"Floodlight Collective\", and eases the listener into Pundt's shimmering sonics in grand fashion. Uncontent to simply loop majestic, if brief, phrases into oblivion, \"Strangers\" arpeggiates a blinding guitar hook that follows Pundt through assured scales of hooky vocal work and initiates the album into a gauzy bliss. The just-as-strong \"Out of Touch\" crescendos into an anthemic chorus that vaguely recalls the equally masterful \"Desire Lines\" from Deerhunter's opus, \"Halcyon Digest\" proving that Lockett Pundt may be the most introverted member of the band but remains, nontheless, an absolutely essential componant to the songwriting duties pit within the band itself. There is an ever-contentious non-debate that has plagued Independent Music since the onset of the Aughties. What exactly warrants the sort of fey, limp branding of \"Indie Music\"? Ramshackle production quality? Thriftstore Virtuosity? This is a particularly relevant question because Indie is a sort of be-all, end-all facade that really is turned into a warning flag for any listener that isn't an all-encompassing music-site frequenter. Lockett Pundt, quiet as he seems, has produced an album so impossibly gorgeous and hook-laden, that Spooky Action serves as a testament to songwriting itself rather than a host of crude genre signifiers. This is not solely \"Indie\" fodder. \"White Galactic One\" exemplifies a shoegazing bent with a sizzling fuzz riff but remains a hooky highlight due to Lockett's sublime way with melody. \"Monoliths\" chorus (of the year) soars into a downright tear-inducing cocaphony because Pundt navigates melodic nuance between each song so consistently that the record has a content circularity that boasts impressive replay-value and lasting testament. We often mistake antics for moral signposts of importance. People -selfishly- appropriate their own stories onto those who would rather gaze or remain silent, and therefore overlook all the good to be had within a person. May this no longer be the case. Spooky Action At A Distance is the perfect marriage between introvert and extrovert. Just supply the memories, please.

Opening", "textAfterTable": "10 Songs Editors\u2019 Notes On Lockett Pundt's second solo outing as Lotus Plaza, it becomes increasingly clear how critical his contributions really are to his other bands (Deerhunter and Atlas Sound). Spooky Action works in a vein similar to those outfits, with pop melodies and sensibilities at the heart of music wrapped in layers of fuzz and warmth.\u00a0There's reverb on the guitars and vocals, along with restrained distortion and effects (appropriately lighthanded, since the feel here is decidedly ethereal). Tight, sturdy percussion is the grounding force. The crisp snares and chiming guitar on \"Strange\" anchor the wispy tune, and the weighty kickdrum gives bounce to the shimmering tambourines and gathering clouds of guitar on \"Out of Touch.\" One strength of this set is its range of feeling, from the artfully thoughtful \"Jet Out of the Tundra,\" to the Yo La Tengo\u2013style gentleness of the lovely \"Dusty Rhodes.\" Lotus Plaza's music complements the best of Deerhunter and Atlas Sound.
