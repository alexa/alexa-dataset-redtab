Also, i am looking specifically for ones with Supernatural or Stargate SG-1/Atlantis crossover. I am new to ficwad and have been having trouble finding the type of stories i would like to read. The categories/search engine is not very helpful in sorting stories by type/genre/pairing/etc. Thanks so much!!!

I don't think they have any slash though, just to warn you. A really really! good story for slash though it the Black Heir on fanfiction.net. And when I say that I truly mean it, cuz I don't usually read slash at all. Between that one and its sequel there's over a million words, supposedly smut to die for that isn't the base of the story(once again, I just skip over those parts) and a plot that I couldn't help but LOVE. But, not a crossover.
