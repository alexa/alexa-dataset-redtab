The Brazilian group didn\u2019t serve up any of the styles typically associated with that country; instead they retooled 1980s alt-rock to create danceable 21st century post-punk. In other words, they have more in common with LCD Soundsystem than Caetano Veloso. Four members of CSS are women \u2014 including lead vocalist Lovefoxxx \u2014 and the lone male in the group, drummer-turned-bassist Adriano Cintra, writes and produces. (Various band members contribute lyrics.) The wildness of Cansei de Ser Sexy is transformed into something more conventional on their second release, Donkey. Insistent guitar, catchy bass lines, synth hooks, and Lovefoxxx\u2019s urgent vocals still mark the group\u2019s sound, but everything here is more shaped and polished. The album\u2019s darkest track, \u201cRat is Dead (Rage),\u201d rides a surf beat and surges like classic Pixies. Another standout, the synth-driven \u201cHow I Became Paranoid,\u201d balances tightly-wound rhythms and an infectious chorus to create edgy pop. It\u2019s hard not to miss the excitement of the first album, but Donkey does capture a band sharpening its sound.
