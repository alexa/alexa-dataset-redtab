Opening with tracks from the band's vicious hardcore debut, Remain Sedate, it is clear that there is nothing happy or overly melodic in the near future. The disc goes on to include tracks culled from a number of 7\" discs that the band appeared on, as well as its second LP, Protestant. As the record progresses, it does seem clear that the band evolved and, by the time Protestant kicks in, the grinding sludge has given way to a more complicated and metal-influenced variation on the original themes. Lead vocalist/screamer Charles Maggio stays pretty consistent throughout the entire production, with his anguished screams making it sound like he's being unrelentingly attacked. Even the closing cover of Black Flag's \"My War\" includes his guttural yelping over the band's evil take on the early hardcore classic. The members of Rorschach are pros at their craft but, after 76 minutes and 31 tracks, it is questionable who can still handle the full force of their brutal attack. Nonetheless, it is a fine collection that showcases the heavy power of Rorschach and puts the band's many efforts in an attractive single package. ~ Peter J.
