Well, well,well! What have we here? Why it's the 28th Anniversary of the Second Decadenal Field Trip to Veneta Oregon featuring \"Good Ol' You Know Who\"! Yep, We finally got around to being able to play a very good soundboard recording of Grateful Dead at Veneta Oregon on August 28th, 1982! With Tom Chiles, and his lovely wife Deb securely in the passenger seat, we began the show with Garcia and Grisman from Not For Kids Only \"A Horse Named Bill\". This was deadicated to my Father Inlaw, and His Wife Carolyn. And after a little dialogue with Tom, we got down to the\u00a0business of playing this great show. What we did not know is that Eli Babbs (son of Ken Babbs, Original Merry\u00a0Prankster) Was listening in and digging the show. After the show, we spoke with him via e-mail, and he agreed to come on the show next Saturday September the 4th with Mathew for more hijinx. You'll want to tune in for that! I know I will! Eli's band \"Lost Creek Gang\" will be at the Mount Tabor Pub that night for a show that also includes The Garcia Birthday Band, and Sugarcane String Band. The evening is called \"Anti Labor Day Bash\" Hosted by Zane Kesey. You know who His Dad is! Doors at 8:00. This is going to be a great night of music, and good times! We hope to see you there as well! I mistakenly thought that\u00a0the set two intro was Ken Kesey. I stand corrected. It was actually Ken Babbs. Sorry! We got all the way through set one and had to call it a day at \"Far From Me\". On my next show September25th, we pick up at \"Playin' In The Band through the end of the show \"Dupree's Diamond Blues\". We'll see you then!
