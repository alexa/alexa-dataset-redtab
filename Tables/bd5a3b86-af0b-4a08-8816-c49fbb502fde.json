Diane Warren's pristine \"Borrowed Angels\" is destined for lite FM radio, and Chenoweth dedicates \"There Will Never Be Another\" to Amy Grant. Though its slickness is suited to the material, As I Am can also seem to flutter inside its own perfect globe, untouched by the elements and radiant as Chenoweth's golden hair. That's why a version of the traditional \"Poor, Wayfaring Stranger\" is so refreshing with its warm B-3 tones and subtly expressive vocal, and the fun closer \"Taylor, the Latte Boy\" \u2014 about Kristin's crush on her Starbucks barista \u2014 is so important. These songs further personalize As I Am; they add a layer of realness to its shiny dedications of faith.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 08:56:36 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Open iTunes to preview, buy and download music.
