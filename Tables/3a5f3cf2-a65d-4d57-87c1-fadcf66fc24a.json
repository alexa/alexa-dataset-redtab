COOKED is same price for Kindle edition on Amazon.ca as Kobo. E-book pricing articles are irrelevant here. \u00a0 \u2014 Jennifer Fox (@theyellowline) July 11, 2013 @thornley @kobo Those are American prices. Even Amazon would be charging you more in Canada. I focused on the fact that my favourite eBook seller, Kobo, was the highest priced seller in all examples.\u00a0I tweeted about this and was promptly called out by Jennifer Fox. Laura Hazard Owen reported yesterday that retailers have begun cutting eBook prices in response to the settlement of the Apple eBook price fixing case. Her post included a table comparing prices at which certain books are offered by the various major eBook retailers in the US. While readers in the US may be benefiting from", "textAfterTable": "Do you see what I see? For Canadians, one high price for each book, regardless of retailer. Canadians are not benefiting from the drop in US eBook prices It\u2019s clear that agency pricing persists in Canada. And that means higher book prices across the board with no competition on price. That\u2019s not good for consumers. That doesn\u2019t promote reading. And that\u2019s something that must change. Now. Not next year. What will it take to end agency pricing of eBooks in Canada? Who will see this as an opportunity and take the lead? I buy from Kobo because of its commitment to ePub standards and its device-agnostic approach. And I\u2019m willing to pay a premium for being part of an open system that lets me consume my books on the device of my choice. So, Kobo, you\u2019ve already got me for the right reasons. Now why don\u2019t you go the next step by seizing the opportunity to break the agency model and lead the way to better book prices for Canadian eBook readers. Kobo, are you listening?
