To answer your question, I don't have a qlue if she have that one. And no her name is not Michelle. \u00a0 \u00a0 harbottle 9th Apr 2012 \u00a0 I have been delving a bit into the A side \"Take Good Care Of My Baby\" and I have come up with 2 \"b\" sides. This one and \"The Price Of Living\" only because on one site this one is listed as \"Williams, Richard\" but i would never have found that if you hadn't posted this one. I take it your sister is a big fan, does she have this one in her collection by the keyboard player Bill Hurd? Is her name Michelle by any chance? \u00a0 \u00a0 SmokeChatter 9th Apr 2012 \u00a0 Thank you for that, you're very wellcome. Have you seen the German release? There is another song on the B-side.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 2, "headerRowIndex": 0}
