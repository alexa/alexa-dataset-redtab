This is like the best song sang by vince vance & te valiants!!!!!!! i would rate this # 1 for all christmas songs!! All I Want For Christmas Is You \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by LT 1 Maybe the best Christmas album I have and I have a lot of them. Just the title song blows you away. Then you have Why Can't You Be Here For Christmas, and Christmas Just Ain't Christmas Without You, two more great ones. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas is sung in a 50's do wop style, a classic performed a totally different way like I've never heard it before. I was happy that I downloaded the whole album. Surprises me that other artists haven't tried recording All I Want For Christmas Is You, maybe they feel they can't match this version.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
