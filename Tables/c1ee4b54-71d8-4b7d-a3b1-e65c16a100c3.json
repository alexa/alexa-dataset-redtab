Get with the program, the man is brilliant, particularly when he is working with The Sunsets. Each album is different yet unmistakably his. Sonny brings the epitome of garage rock, yet flavored by whatever kind of weird shit he is going through that year. Last year's record was a country rock album that was inspired by a tragic break-up (and a great album). This one is a R.Stevie Moore/Cleaners From Venus styled bedroom rocker inspired by the terrible murder of their close friend Esme Barrera and Mr. Smith's apparent psychic abilities. If you dig off-kilter yet catchy music, you should probably get with Sonny and The Sunsets! Thank me later.
