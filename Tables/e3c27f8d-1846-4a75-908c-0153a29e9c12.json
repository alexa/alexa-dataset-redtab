I've learnt quite a lot working on this response! I plugged in \u70b8\u91ac into the Japanese Google image search engine: http://images.google.co.jp/images?hl=ja&lr=lang_ja&um=1&sa=1&q=%E7%82%B8... And found lots of delicious looking Jah Jan noodle pictures. I'm going to combine Jah Jan Sauce with minced Quorn (a meat substitute popular in the UK) and have it with drained noodles and shredded cucumber. Hopefully, it will turn out something like this - http://blog-imgs-31.fc2.com/l/i/m/limesoda/DSCF1026.jpg Thank you for the inspiration!, 16518=As a cheat, I also like to mix cooled, cooked Japanese rice with Mandarin Jah Jan sauce (Mong Lee Shang brand http://shop.waiyeehong.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=...) and a few chopped vegetables (the vegetables are optional, but if you fry some diced shallot and zuchini/courgette and brown a little before adding the sauce and rice they should hardly be noticeable to vegetable haters!). Actually, I'm drooling now just thinking about it... must get some more! I'd never heard of Jah Jan sauce - also called Zha jiang sauce - until my husband introduced it to me, apparently it's quite well known in Japan (\u70b8\u91ac?), but as an accompaniment to noodles.*}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:22:21 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "New forum activity since your last visit More information about formatting options Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.
