This one does all that. I have been listening to it for day and I can\u2019t seem to put it down. It really speaks to me on many levels. There is so much passion in the music, lyrics and vocals in this album. This album finds the perfect balance between gentle and powerful, past and future, complex and simple, sad and hopeful. Listening to it, you can feel the tension between boundaries and expansion and it takes you on a ride through that experience. I think Robert Oakes has a message to deliver about love and hope and manages to communicate it with music that is truly beautiful to experience.
