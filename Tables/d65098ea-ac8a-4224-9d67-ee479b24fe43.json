Chili Pepper's drummer Chad Smith has been very busy this year, with Chickenfoot and this side project, and he'll only get busier with the Peppers' reuniting. But, busy isn't necessarily a bad thing. These instrumental tracks really give Chad a chance to just sort of explore the kit to serve the music, and as always with Chad there are some great and funky licks on here. These guys aren't your normal band, they are an instrumental fusion of jazz, funk, and rock. They won't be everyone's cup of tea. However, if you don't mind sexy instrumental grooves then check em' out. Great music, great chemistry, and great musicians make for a great time. Brilliant \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by fartbubble This record blew me out of the water. By far the coolest instrumental record I have heard in a long time.
