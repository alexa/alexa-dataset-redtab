Playing in various bands around town, it wasn't until 2001 that the four friends came together as one cohesive unit to create introspective indie rock that, while sonically similar to bands like Switchfoot, draws influence ranging from underground punk to the Counting Crows to Kid Dynamite. Within six months of forming, the band \u2014 Joel Hamilton (vocals/guitar/piano), Adam Pavao (guitar), Chris Ginn (bass), and Ross Taylor (percussion/drums) \u2014 self-released and self-produced their debut effort, Sincerely, and independently sold a few thousand copies around their hometown. Universal's Kevin Law took notice, and the Working Title soon became the first band signed to his Universal imprint, Cause for Alarm. The seven-song Everyone Here Is Wrong EP was issued in late 2003, and the band's subsequent tour schedule included shows with Mae, mewithoutYou, Switchfoot, and Our Lady Peace, along with various Warped Tour dates. Their debut record, About-Face, appeared in summer 2006, as the guys opened a month of shows on the Goo Goo Dolls and Counting Crows' joint tour.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{51748=2001 in Charleston, SC, 59959=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
