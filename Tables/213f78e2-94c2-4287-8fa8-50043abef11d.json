Initially, companies that provide Sony with PSP components were told by Sony that it needed enough parts to manufacture the 18 million systems that it planned to ship out during the current fiscal year.

Anyway, back to the show. Another new title, THQ's racer, Juiced, is coming in at number five. And Destroy All Humans! enters the fray at number eight. There are many new titles making their debut this week, which is always exciting. What is less-than-exciting, though, is that there are many instances of the same game for different consoles on the list, not to mention the lack of RPGs. I guess you can't win them all.
