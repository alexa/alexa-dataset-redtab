Although he has no idea of what he's done, Ness has managed to tap into the highest power of Rockin' at this point. However, without being strong enough to control it, all he can manage is a generic beam attack that is a little bit weaker than the real thing.", "Darrow3 - #24 An incredible dilemma occurs as Ness comes to a horrible realization. In order to rescue Paula, he must get the trout yogurt dispenser, but in order to get to the dispenser he has to use the Pencil Eraser, which Paula is holding onto. Well, it's been a fun run, but the comic has to restart now. See you on page 1!", "Darrow5 - #60 While it may not be able to screech its way out of this encasing of ice, there is one other trick the Kraken is capable of.", "Darrow2 - #59 The battle ends, but there's little reward for Ness. The hollow victory brings the realization of his failure to save Paula even with the Spook defeated.", "Darrow3 - #25 Oh, we're still going? Hey! Tracy! Well, thanks to the efforts of little sis, the story can continue properly.
