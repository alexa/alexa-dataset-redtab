Don't bother buying this. Get a real DJ to make a mix for you, or buy something from Ultra Records. At least they use the original artists. This is terrible. And the music industry wonders why it's going down the tubes. Why the cover bands? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by HenryHobNJ I'm a big eighties fan, and I can see how these would be good cardio songs. I'm just shocked that Men's Fitness didn't just license the ORIGINAL works. These \"covers\" are like listening to Kareokee. Very cheesy.
