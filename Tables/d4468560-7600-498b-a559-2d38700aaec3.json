The former members of Dropkick Murphys, Welt, and the Bruisers are as rowdy and invigorated as ever. Apart from Mike McColgan\u2019s voice sounding a little more husky with age, and new drummer Paul Rucker (who replaces ex-Mighty Mighty Bosstones drummer Joe Sirois) behind the set, it\u2019s just another day for the Irish-American lads. With the type of crowd-rousing, drunken, bagpipe punk that Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly, and Scotch Greens deliver, McColgan takes issue with the system: targeting corporate greed (\u201cUp the Union [EFCA]\u201d), media overload (\u201cToo Much Information\u201d), fraudulent stock brokers (\u201cHang Him High [65 Billion]\u201d), Oregon\u2019s lousy economy (\u201cPortland\u201d), and FM radio programming (\u201cPoor Jimmy\u201d) in his lyrics. But to quote, \u201cIt doesn't really matter what the singer says, as long as punk rock is beating in those heads.\u201d Customer Reviews Street Dogs = The Best Punk \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by skaFanatic This is a great album from an awesome working-class punk band.
