Was and Midler also satisfy the need for up-tempo material with a trio of genre exercises, Latin pop in \"In These Shoes,\" mbaqanga in \"Moses,\" and dance in \"Bless You Child.\" Bette is a tasteful album that showcases Midler's expressive singing but avoids her excesses. \"In These Shoes\" is an amusing novelty that does not play too heavily to the singer's broad comic style, while ballads like \"Color of Roses\" and \"When Your Life Was Low\" are striking for their restraint, not going for the maudlin extremes Midler has been guilty of indulging in the past.
