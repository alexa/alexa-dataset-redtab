After several years, the band broke up (they argued over who had performed better on The Tube). Mansell, along with future Poppies Adam Mole and Graham Crabb, then recruited the fourth Poppie, Richard March, and proceeded to release an EP as Wild and Wandering. On their next EP, self-released, the band finally came to rest with the name Pop Will Eat Itself, stolen from an NME article.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{64307=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
