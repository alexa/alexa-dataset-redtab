Talahomi Way is O\u2019Hagan\u2019s easy listening album. It features bossa nova beats, airy woodwinds and strings that evoke Nelson Riddle as much as anything by Parks. The album is a beaut. If anyone has a right to the music of the Mad Men era, it\u2019s a careful scholar like O\u2019Hagan, who with Microdisney, Stereolab and the High Llamas has explored this terrain with authority. \u201cWoven and Rolled\u201d has a horn section adding brightness to this mix of acoustic guitars, strings and halting beats. \u201cThe Ring of Gold\u201d strolls past with a spring breeze that reminds one of the glories of stereophonic recordings. There\u2019s a slight rockabilly twinkle to the light and fluffy \u201cA Rock In May.\u201d The album is packed with retro-surprises. But it suffers not from a nostalgic eye. O\u2019Hagan is merely exploring a genre that has yet to be exhausted., 127571=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
