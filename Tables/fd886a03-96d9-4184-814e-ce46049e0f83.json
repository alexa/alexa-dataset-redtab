Eclipsing\u2019s 11 tracks flow together as a whole, but a variety of influences inform them, from bluegrass to gospel to shoegaze. Page Campbell and Dan Donahue call to mind the work of slowcore greats Low, in that they take rustic sounds and give them new vibrancy. They also know when to break the spell, as when the drums of standout \u201cWild Fires\u201d light up the sounds around them with a sudden immediacy, which is also reflected in the vocals, which move from gauzy atmosphere to impassioned wail. On a cold, rainy winter night, the sweet sound of Dream Boat could just be your savior. 12/03/2012 Another dreamy album made for me. It reminds me of Azure Ray and Maria Taylor. The second track on this album is \"Sea To Sky\" and it is one of my favorite songs of the year. Seriously one of the most beautiful and haunting songs that I have ever heard. I listened to it about ten times the first time that I heard it.
