But Japan has moved on and less and less merchandising with this theme is available each year. You can still get water bottles and coffee cups and a few other goods with NBC motifs but nothing like before. My suggestion would be a Japanese Disney Store or somewhere like calamel.jp I'll be visiting Tokyo Disney in just over a month and can ask there (the Disney shops there have the widest range of Disney merchandise in Japan)- but I'll be with my father-in-law and have a toddler in tow who may or may not be co-operative so I'm not sure how much time I can dedicate to this. If you know anyone else going to Tokyo Disney this could well be your best option.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 03:34:21 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "New forum activity since your last visit More information about formatting options Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.
