Other tracks veer toward country (\"Cold Cold Heart\") or teen-oriented pop (\"Two Young Fools in Love\"), and the collection is rounded out with both sides of a single she recorded with a vocal group as the Sunrays and many alternate takes and demos. Pittman is revered by rockabilly cultists as a pioneering woman of rock & roll, but her legacy mostly boils down to the few aforementioned rockabilly cuts; the remaining material is largely disposable, particularly the inferior alternate takes.
