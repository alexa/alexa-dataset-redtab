The Portuguese-Canadian songstress forsakes the mainstream dance-pop of 2006\u2019s Loose in favor of something riskier and ultimately more satisfying. In these tracks, Furtado works within the boundaries of the Latin market without sublimating her own freewheeling personality. In her typically eclectic fashion, she combines earthy traditional instrumentation with contemporary techno-dance beats, never stinting on the pop hooks in the process. Tracks like \u201cBajo Otra Luz\u201d (a reggaeton/cumbia fusion featuring rapper La Mala Rodriguez) and \u201cFuerto\u201d (Spanish in feel, with a sleekly contemporary groove) glide with an easy yet insistent flow. As on previous releases, Furtado doesn\u2019t shy away from soul-bearing \u2014 the volatile \u201cManos al Aire\u201d and the tender \u201cJosh Groban\u201d (the latter a duet with Josh Groban) hold little back emotionally. Acoustic-centered numbers like \u201cSuenoz\u201d and \u201cMas\u201d are reminiscent of her early work, while \u201cSufficient Tempo\u201d is a straight shot into today\u2019s high-gloss Latin pop.
