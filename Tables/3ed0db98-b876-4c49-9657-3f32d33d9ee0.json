Well, even though I got better results than I expected with a \"fur\" filter, I thought he looked \"fluffy\" more than anything, like he'd just been put into a clothes dryer and came out all cozy and warm. :) A fun experiment though!", "\"But it's the Major one you want to fight.\" I'd started this one pondering the idea that the Psychic Psycho wasn't so much on fire, but that his suit has become a sort of psyonically-generated living flame. Well, I goofed somehwere along the way in drawing it and saved it as a png and its layers weren't preserved... Oh well. I abandonned it but submitted it anyway, 'cause it still was looking kinda' cool.", "\"Don't get the gray swirl!\". A Criminal Catepillar on a desert background (which was fun to draw). I still can't believe that I forgot to draw his arms. x_x", "\"Handsomely Handsome Puppet\". I'm a big fan of Threed's Handsome Tom. Sure, it was merely an alternate palette version of Smilin' Sam, but come ON! He's a puppet/ dummy that has purple skin and white hair. How creepy is THAT? And how creepy is the person who'd have made him? Handsome Tom is cool.", "\"Help!\" Mr. Molecule is one of those enemies that just about anyone could draw, due to its simplicity. I wanted to draw him too, but do something different. I thought about trying to assemble a large, compound mollectule out of Mr. Mollecules but decided against it, figuring it'd be better suited at a 3D artist. So I decided on a regular formation of Mr. Mollecules, to form a magnified bit of crystal. I made the \"atom\" balls a bit on the blurry side to illustrate the \"whirlingness\" of their electrons. ;P"], ["Date", "4/26/05", "4/27/05", "4/27/05", "4/26/05", "4/27/05"], ["Rank", "0.00", "0.00", "8.00", "0.00", "0.00"]], "pageTitle": "STARMEN.NET - EarthBound / Mother 3 Goodness.", "title": "", "url": "http://starmen.net/vote/vote.php?id=10456&stuff=DescASC", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042987127.36/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002307-00277-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 226788547, "recordOffset": 226780566, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "textBeforeTable": "> Z Y W U T S R P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A 8 7 < Other Submissions by ozwalled A Bionic Kraken in the Sea of Eden.
