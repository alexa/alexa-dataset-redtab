Its called Aeolian Shawl by Elizabeth Freeman. I used Cashmere Merino Silk 2/28 in Kaki with US 4 needles and size 8 beads. This is my first lace project as well as the first time I ever read a chart. I was surprised myself on how well it came out considering all the firsts. I'm starting another shawl in Extra Fine Merino 2/28.

I've used 938 grams to knit this and used two patterns to obtain the necessary number of stitches and design as very few patterns are available for much larger sizes. Have laundered this and found it retained it's width but lost 2\" in length from nape to hem. It now wonderful and soft. Used 50% M&S Cashmere washing liquid and 50% fairy liquid. Seems to have worked very well. Tumbled dry on low heat until almost dry then hung in my pantry [where central heating boiler is - so dried completely over night]. Delighted with results!

This was published by Laura Fry in Twill Thrills. The yarn behaved beautifully with hardly any tangling. I expected it to be really tricky but not at all. I used a 50 epi sett and threaded 600 ends. I wove to 70\" The right hand floating selvedge broke three times but I think it was 'operator' error ! When washed the scarf did not shrink much but the yarn became very very soft.

It's a marled yarn with the two colours very close to each other in value, which gives a velvety depth that is very, very hard to photograph. I photoshopped till I was blue in the face trying to get the hue and saturation right, and I came close but, alas, no cigar. The yarn bloomed beautifully upon washing and is very soft.
