Angel on the other hand is a little different. But it is PERFECT for theory of a deadman. As much as I want this album to be heavy heavy heavy. theory excels in the soft ballad songs. Angel continues right on that line way over produced \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Critic on Critics ive never been their number 1 fan or anything and I never want to be because I'm reading these 5 star reviews and these people have very low standards.The grittiness is gone. Nothing about this stands out at all. If you liked the song drown and you know what their past stuff sounds like, your opinion is completely invalid. Mark me down you low standard fans.
