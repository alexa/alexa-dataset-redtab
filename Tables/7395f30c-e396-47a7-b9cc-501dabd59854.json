To be sure, there are plenty of stellar producers (including Xenomania and Timbaland) on board to frame Lewis in stylish, high-gloss settings. The steamy \u201cCan\u2019t Breathe,\u201d the throbbing \u201cFly Here Now\u201d and the epochal \u201cLost Then Found\u201d (featuring One Republic in seven-plus minutes of uplifting gospel/pop glory) load on the melodrama effectively. But even when she reaches for the Big Note, Lewis radiates honesty and class, as in the aching survivor\u2019s anthem \u201cHappy.\u201d The sleek \u201cLove Letter\u201d and the techno-fueled \u201cOutta My Head\u201d lend some pop sparkle to the proceedings, and for extra celeb content, Justin Timberlake shares vocals on the slow-simmering \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Down.\u201d Throughout, Lewis shows taste and poise, knowing when to turn up her vocal power and when to hold back.
