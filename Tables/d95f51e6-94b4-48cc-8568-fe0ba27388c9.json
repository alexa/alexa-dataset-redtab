There aren't any amazing tracks to the game, but some of the music is interesting. The fighters have introduction music that fits their ethnicity which is a nice touch, but most of the tracks are short fanfares. There are several versions of this game including Mike Tyson's Punch-Out for (NTSC and PAL versions), Punch-Out for the USA and Japan, and the Mike Tyson's Punch-Out PC10 edition. However, the music is identical through each incarnation except in the Japanese Punch-Out where the title bout music is unique. This has yet to be ripped, but when it is, it will be recorded as well.
