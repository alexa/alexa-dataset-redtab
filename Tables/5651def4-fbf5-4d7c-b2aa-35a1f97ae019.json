The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai is the first user created title for the Xbox 360 that the ESRB has rated. What is interesting is that The Dishwasher garnered an \u2018M\u2019 rating for \u201cBlood and Gore, Violence\u201d. Not surprising based on the demo and trailer I saw. Still, right off the bat this title should be unavailable to any Xbox 360 that has an under aged Gamercard or the Family Settings set to prevent the play or downloading of \u2018M\u2019 rated content. It makes you wonder how this will impact the sales of these titles, and whether the developers will have the opportunity to go back and tone the game down to get the more retail friendly \u2018T\u2019 for Teen rating. Other than the \u2018M\u2019 garnered by The Dishwasher, the fact that these titles are starting to show up means we are getting closer to the launch of this new user created games through Live Marketplace. It remains to be seen when these games will pop on the service, but after the Fall Dash redesign would be my best guess. The Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 had another solid week, with the PS3 even having a non-shared title on the list. They both had the following games rated: Fallout 3, Civil War: Secret Missions, James Bond: Quantum of Solace, Golden Axe: Beast Rider, WWE SmackDown", "textAfterTable": "Here is the final tally on who, what and where everything was rated for the last week. There were 85 rated titles on nine platforms. PC (27), Wii (14), Xbox 360 (11), Playstation 3 (8), DS (8), Playstation 2 (8) and Mac (5) had the most games rated. There were 42 of the 85 titles rated at E10+ or lower, seven rated at T for Teen and six (Ubersoldier 2, Far Cry, Fallout 3, THE LAST REMNANT, The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai and Golden Axe: Beast Rider) rated at M for Mature.
