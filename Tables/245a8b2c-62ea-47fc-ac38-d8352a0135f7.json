He emulates an orchestra even when playing solo, so it is not surprising that this outing with 21 other musicians in an impressive all-star band is intense and passionate. Camilo performs ten of his originals on this date including the blues \"One More Once,\" an atmospheric \"Dreamlight,\" \"Caribe,\" \"Just Kidding\" and his \"hit\" \"Why Not.\" Among the notables heard from are tenor saxophonist Ralph Bowen, altoist Paquito d'Rivera, Chris Hunter on soprano and alto, and trumpeter Michael Mossman, but Camilo is the main star throughout. The catchy rhythms make the music accessible but the pianist never coasts or takes it easy, constantly challenging himself. Recommended. Customer Reviews Brilliance \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by mrbass1999 One of the best albums to play through a big bad speaker system... in a word its HUGE, the highs and the lows.... Anthony Jackson on bass... no fan of latin/fusion/jazz could be disappointed with this Album. Biography Born: 04 April", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
