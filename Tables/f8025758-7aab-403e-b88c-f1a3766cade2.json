It's a strong if characteristic collection of rugged country folk-rock sung with Hayes Carll's Texas drawl, that seems to be somewhat exaggerated so that we know he's from the land of Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, and Guy Clark, some obvious influences that snake through these 14 tracks. He's been there and done that, struggling through years of the hard living that informs tunes such as the humorous take on his trying times detailed in the self-explanatory \"I Got a Gig.\" The usual suspect topics of heavy drinking, bad wimmen, hell raisin', misplaced love and life along the lost highway dominate the lyrics, and even though Carll isn't exploring these well-worn subjects in particularly new ways, his melodies, words, and especially his professional backing are strong enough to put them over in tunes that aren't as clich\u00e9d as the topics covered. He also has a wry, dry sense of humor, best exemplified in \"She Left Me for Jesus\" (\"She left me for Jesus,\" and that just ain't fair, she says that 'he's perfect.' How could I compare\").
