The Jammington is his fourth album (following Carnage, Chaundon Presents...Baby Making Music, and No Excuses), and it finds him sounding stronger than ever. The short but sweet 10-track project gives fans everything they'd hope for in a compact 30-minute package, with slick punchlines and chuckle-inducing storytelling. He sounds especially dope on the super-soulful \"Hindsight,\" the smooth-talking ladies' jam \"Mandatory,\" and the big-girl anthem \"BBW\" (which revisits the classic \"It Takes Two\" beat). He also addresses the breakup of his old crew Justus League over sweeping strings on \"Loyalty Is Royalty\" and examines the gap between rich and poor on the spooky, flute-laced \"Prosperity.\" Customer Reviews Hip\u2026Hop... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by flexxxxx Wow.
