The 20/20 Experience makes up for lost time and catapults the Emmy\u00ae and Grammy\u00ae Award-winning entertainer back into the spotlight. \u201cSuit & Tie\u201d with JAY Z was just a stinging jab; now get ready for the knockout punch.\u00a0 Customer Reviews Potential...... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by GWill80 From what I have heard so far this album has the potential to be a great one.
