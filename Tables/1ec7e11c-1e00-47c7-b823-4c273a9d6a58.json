Most of his records are squarely in the same groove \u2014 straightforward old-school honky tonk stuff made notable by Brown's blazing hot guitar work (performed on his \"guit-steel,\" a self-designed double-neck instrument that fuses a lap steel with a Telecaster) and his sly but down-home sense of humor, and while Junior's craggy voice doesn't boast much range, he has a great sense of just where to drop the notes within his deep-in-a-well tone. Given the consistency of Brown's music (and the fact that Brown hasn't enjoyed much in the way of chart success), you could pluck nearly any 12 tunes from his five albums for Curb and end up with a solid disc that represents his career well enough, and while Brown's Greatest Hits has been put together with a bit more care than that, there isn't much unexpected on it. There are no rarities or unreleased cuts, and pretty much anything that got any play on CMT or TNN (which were more receptive to the man's music than country radio has been) is on board. (Since Brown is no longer recording for Curb, chances are he didn't have much say about this set,", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
