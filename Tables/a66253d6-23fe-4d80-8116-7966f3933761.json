The Library, on E. Carson St., South Side. On the site of the old Brady Street Bridge Tavern, approximately 22nd St and E. Carson. Good selection of craft beers on tap. The bartender is very well-versed in all of them and many more. Generous with samples of the various offerings. Food is good also.", "I\u2019ve been told this before and have been meaning to check this place out. Thanks for reminding me.", "The Library also has very good wings. They are kind of expensive, but they have an all you can eat wing special on Tuesday I believe. These are some of the biggest wings (of chicken) I\u2019ve ever seen."]], "pageTitle": "Bike Pittsburgh | Topic: Best Watering Holes For Cyclists/Rides!", "title": "", "url": "http://bikepgh.org/mb/topic/best-watering-holes-for-cyclistsrides-2/", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988458.74/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00046-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 23261776, "recordOffset": 23253574, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 \u2190 Forums Home Viewing 3 posts - 1 through 3 (of 3 total) This topic contains 2 replies, has 3 voices, and was last updated by \u00a0brybot 2 yrs, 5 mos.
