His self-titled debut was released in early 2003 and featured jazzy takes on old standards like \"Fever\" and \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" as well as newer classics like Van Morrison's \"Moondance\" and the Bee Gees' \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.\" Further exposure ensued with a world tour and appearances on several television programs like NBC's Today Show, in which he sang a duet with host Katie Couric. He finished off 2003 with an EP of holiday material, Let It Snow, and began 2004 with the live CD/DVD set Come Fly with Me. In 2005, It's Time was a number one hit in Canada, Japan, Italy, and Australia, and made the Top Ten of both the U.K. and U.S. charts. Later that year he released the live album Caught in the Act. The holiday-themed album Christmas followed in 2006, with the studio effort Call Me Irresponsible dropping in 2007. Bubl\u00e9 returned in 2009 with the live concert album/DVD Michael Bubl\u00e9 Meets Madison Square Garden, which documented the singer's first-ever performance at the storied New York City venue., 35972=The studio effort Crazy Love, featuring duets with Sharon Jones and Ron Sexsmith, followed in October 2009, becoming his third multi-platinum album in the U.S. In 2010, Bubl\u00e9 released the six-song EP Special Delivery, as well as the expanded Crazy Love: Hollywood Edition. The holiday album Christmas appeared in late 2011, featuring duets with Shania Twain, the Puppini Sisters, and Thal\u00eda. Within a few weeks of release, the album topped Billboard's Top 200. In 2013, Bubl\u00e9 released the Bob Rock-produced To Be Loved, which featured a mix of standards, most contemporary, along with three Bubl\u00e9 originals. Guest vocalists including Reese Witherspoon and Naturally 7 appeared on the album, which became his fourth consecutive chart-topper in the U.S. and also his fourth Grammy winner. Buoyed by the album's success, he set out on a massive tour, debuting in June of 2013 with ten shows at London's O2 Arena, and playing North America, Europe, Australia, South America, Asia, and Africa over the next two years.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{94547=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
