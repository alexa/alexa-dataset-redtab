All rights reserved., 15357=Born: 06 May 1964 in London, England, 14271=Commissioned for the wedding of a career-long fan, Robin Rimbaud (aka Scanner) was asked to create new pieces of material to commemorate the special day. The resulting seven-song suite differs from the majority of his works, as it is significantly warmer and much more accessible than most compositions in his challenging catalog. The soft, overly chorused guitar of the album's opener \"Walk Gently Through the World\" has a welcome, warm feeling almost perfectly crafted for the bride's walk down the aisle. The droning, dry string sweeps of \"Silent Unspoken Memories\" are a nod in the direction of some of Wolfgang Voigt's finest work with his Gas project and easily bests anything on the Kompakt Pop Ambient 2005 compilation. The album's closer pushes Rimbaud to engage in some of his most rhythmic and straightforward material before landing softly on a reprise of the album's opening moments. If only more weddings had a soundtrack like this.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 08:09:45 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "View In iTunes Spore 5. View In iTunes Rockets, Unto the Edges of Edges 4.
