He spent hours in his room teaching himself to play the guitar and by the age of 15, he was already writing his own songs. In 2007 a serious accident nearly cost him his life when he fell from a 3-storey building. His recovery involved a long stay in hospital and months more in a wheelchair, uncertain whether he would ever walk again. Despite this, Andrew looks back on this period as a gift: it imbued in him a renewed zest for life and following his complete recovery he took to gigging six-nights a week, all over Ireland, and in London's '100 Club' and 'Ronnie Scott's'. \u00a0In 2010, he wrote and recorded his first album,\u00a0Hidden In Plain Sight, in 2010. He is currently recording his second album for release this summer. \u00a0Andrew is known to many people from his appearance on\u00a0The Voice Of Ireland\u00a0in 2013, when he got to the quarter-finals of the live shows. This is not Andrew's first foray into Eurosong: he entered in 2012 with the song\u00a0Here I Am, and came a close second to Jedward's\u00a0Waterline., 39540=IRELAND\u2019S EUROVISION RECORD 1965 \u2013 2013, 20319=From Sunday, July 26th, for five weeks, Mooney Goes Wild will be broadcast live between 10am and 11am.
