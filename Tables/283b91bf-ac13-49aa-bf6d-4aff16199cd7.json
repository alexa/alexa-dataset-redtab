So I chose a game that just seemed like it wasn\u2019t needed at all, and that was Campus by Toppware Interactive. I think we all knew it would be coming eventually, but this sim about campus life seems like it may not have any legs unless it delves into the worlds of fraternities, party life and Big Time College sports. Based on the fact that the game was rated E for Everyone for content that includes mild language and use of tobacco, I\u2019m guessing this will be the most unrealistic sim ever made. Most of us over the age of 25 probably want to forget our campus years, and those that are still in college don\u2019t need a Sim to tell them what it is all about. Not to mention the fact that this game was originally released in October of 2007, so I have no idea why the ESRB is just now providing a rating. The Xbox 360 and PS3 had several titles rated this week. Each had Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution and Codemaster\u2019s Grid come across. In addition, the 360 had three titles that have been flying below the radar. The retail title Backyard Baseball \u201909 and XBLA titles CrazyMouse and Golf: Tee it Up!
