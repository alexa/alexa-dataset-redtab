His latest release, Shut Down the Streets, is his most ambitious yet, adding more instrumental flourish to his palette of British invasion-inspired pop songwriting. \u201cI\u2019m Not Talking\u201d opens the album lushly with keyboard washes taking the song to epic status. \u201cDo Your Own Time\u201d is the sort of thumping pop song he\u2019s done so well in the past, featuring Neko Case on backup vocals, but the sound of it is boosted by tasteful touches of Italian-style guitar and vibraphone. His Pornographers bandmate appears again on \u201cEncyclopedia of Classic Takedowns,\u201d one of the album\u2019s strongest tracks, which doesn\u2019t feature too many classic takedowns, but does have a wonderfully bright chorus, thanks to Case, who\u2019s both one of the best lead and backup vocalists in rock. When not aiming for hookiness as much, Newman\u2019s lyrical wordplay comes into effect more \u2014 \u201cI want to tell you that there\u2019s money in new wave\u201d is a weird but memorable chorus, on the album\u2019s folksiest song. In the end, it\u2019s what Newman does best that shines here \u2014 the soaring, singalong chorus. Even on a low-key song with obtuse verses like \u201cWasted English,\u201d Newman can\u2019t resist adding making a seemingly bummer chorus like \u201cIs it too much to lose or too little left", "textAfterTable": "BUY $15.98 SHIPS FREE in U.S. Also available in: LP , Download User Reviews Overall Rating 0 Submissions RATE & REVIEW Who We Are Amoeblog Buy Sell Trade News & Contests Gift Certificates Contact Us Support & FAQ Sign-up for email news, sales alerts & more:", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
