Lunch Money lyrics up to now have mainly focused on seeing the world through a carefree, precocious child's eyes. The songs now point more directly to Molly's experiences as a parent, reading like excerpts from love letters to her kids (\"You were a Basket of Flowers\" , \"Awake\", \"A Walk in the Rain\".) The emotional details paint a very universal mural, capturing the Yin and Yang of our own feelings about our children. In the title track 'Spicy Kid', we get to relive the instant we saw our kid as a complete person, a person independent of our parenting and our genes. \"Watching you trying to cheat at games, in the most creative ways... I'd stop you, but I'm still amazed.\" Some of the standouts include: \"Time Out\"-- Ironically, it's over too quickly,", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
