This was a bit tougher to do than I'd anticipated, as the paint would sometimes peel around places that were being carved. It was also a bit of a last-minute thing. The photos were taken with a disposable camera (I don't own one otherwise), and they came out blurrier than I would have liked. If you look closely, you can see a \"BLEW\" carved there as well.", "The Rosemary House, from Mother 1. Done in late September, in anticipation of the Funfest, while I was thinking about what to make as an entry. Acrylics on canvas.", "Dungeon Man. Experimenting with watercolour pencils, on printer paper. I wanted to try out my new watercolour pencils, so I started testing them on regular paper, with plans to eventually move on to watercolour paper that wouldn't wrinkle so bad. The paper IS quite wrinkled, but I pressed on my scanner lid pretty hard to flatten the scan out. :D", "After I'd finished Giygas (painting 2), I had some paint left over, and painted this on an envelope. At the time I submitted this, it wasn't addressed to anyone, though I imagine that may eventually change. Here, with little leftover paint to work with, I tried to sculpt a bit of definition to lines on Giygas' face.", "A Giygas painting based on a previous Giygas painting I made. A very good friend of mine saw it while visiting my apartment, and asked me to make one for her. This was the result. I purposely kept the colour simpler this time around.
