That the EP is made up of songs weaker than anything either band has previously released is also not really a surprise. Out Hud contribute three mixes of \"JGNE,\" the first a rather straightforward disco punk cabinet-shaker with a naggingly insistent melody. \"JGNDG\" is basically the same only with a fuzzier, more distorted bass and rhythm track. \"JGNXTC\" pushes the melody to the side, turning the beat into an abstract drone that goes nowhere for five and a half minutes. !!! turn in \"Instinct,\" a 12-minute disco stomper with a steady beat, urgent vocals, and parping horn section. Recorded in 1998, it displays a harder edge that the band's more recent material and while it is not essential, it makes for a good listen and would fit well on a mixtape of modern disco-punk., 110053=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
