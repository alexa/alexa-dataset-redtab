All of the elements are there: the hummable but strangely dissonant melodies, the fresh-sounding percussion workouts, and the quirky sense of humor that graced the majority of Zappa's works. But it's not all about Zappa either; there's a trace element of Captain Beefheart, Stravinsky, and modern-day artists like labelmate Kid 606 that, when put together, form the basis of Michel's extremely fresh approach to IDM composition. Much like madman/genius Brian Wilson, Michel juxtaposes instruments with such bright and resilient tones over one another that amid the frenetic chaos of the arrangements it somehow makes sense. It's a perfect fusion of the academic sensibilities and rampant aesthetic Tigerbeat so fiercely holds near and dear to their hearts. Easily one of the most challenging listens in their catalog and essential for fans of both camps.
