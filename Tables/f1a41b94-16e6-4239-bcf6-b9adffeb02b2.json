Jackson's effort is underscored by his continued partnership with Canadian composer Howard Shore, whose soundtrack for The Hobbit has a grand, Wagnerian bombast similar to his Oscar-winning scores for the Rings trilogy. Often ominous, the London Philharmonic's formidable brass section executes the work here with lots of electrifying drama. But lighter moments, like \u201cThe World Ahead\u201d or \u201cA Very Respectable Hobbit,\u201d offer moments of levity. The soundtrack is rounded out by an original song from Neil Finn, known for his leadership of the New Zealand rock outfit Crowded House. When you pre-order the album, Neil Finn's \"Song of the Lonely Mountain\" will start downloading immediately. You'll be charged for the track, and the remainder of the album\u2019s cost will be charged separately when it becomes available. An email will remind you to download your copy.
