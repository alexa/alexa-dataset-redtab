Memory should run significantly lower now. 1.1.1 (The Original UI) removed: tellmewhen 2.0.0 (The TukUI) tuk ui updated, added Basicbuffs, Basicchatmods, Genie, Power Auras, Tidyplates (removed uneeded themes and only kept neon and hub), tuk ui dbm skin, and I readded omen. Updated to current UI not gonna list allt he changes, still playing around with stuff though so don't be suprised you might see more updates soon) 2.1.0 (The TukUI) Another complete overhaul Should run at less than 2mb of memory now (yeah roughly 1.3 mb is actually just Aurora and Masque alone) 3.0 (The Fancy UI) Removed Addon Control Panel (felt it was unnecessary) 4.0 (The lumen UI) Minor bug fixes if any at all swapped Postal for OpenAll(fan update) I only really used the Openall option for postal anyway.
