Rock is back in Dallas \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Max L. Billington ...and it's about time! Frequenting the local music scene in Dallas several years ago, you could hear plenty of great bands; then something happened and they all went away. The Circle is one of a few bands that are reviving the rock music scene in Dallas with a vengeance. The latest EP entitled \"Who I Am\" is a perfect example of what happens when talent and determination converge to produce what I am sure will be the first of several releases from The Circle. Skip your latte, save a few bucks, and give this a download and a listen. You won't regret it. -Max L.
