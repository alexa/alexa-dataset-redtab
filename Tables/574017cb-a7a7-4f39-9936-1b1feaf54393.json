If you like the story, rate it! Posted at 2008-05-25 0:50", "I somewhat agree. But, a review tells the reader what they really think of the story. But, I do think ratings are just as important. And it's far easier and quicker to rate than it is to take your time to review. =/ Posted at 2008-05-26 15:31", "*the writer. Not the reader. I despise typos.

Posted at 2008-05-27 23:44", "I think reviews are important, and as a writer, I love them. But, I know, sometimes when reading I don't want to write up how and why a fic is good or bad. I rate to let the community know what fics, in my opinion are worth reading, or not. But sadly, it is a common courtesy overlooked by many.

A long time ago (look at the very last page of the categories) people rated stuff a lot. Most of the stories on the very last pages are green!! I am just a little bit jealous. Posted at 2008-06-10 6:01", "The green stories on the last page are partly because if a story has been around for years, it's probably received 5 ratings. My newer stuff is better, but unrated.

Posted at 2008-06-11 1:02", "ratings are convienient, i mean you don't always have the words to relate your response to a given story, but it still shows your appreciation (or at least that someone bothered to actually read it which is a nice feeling) and gives the writer an idea of what was good or needs improvement. it amazes me that anyone could read thru a catagory all the way. man, that's kind of awesome.
