At about the halfway mark, I mixed a mediascape of Senator Bernie Sanders heroic, though sadly ignored voice of reason filibuster speech to the Senate - trying to dissuade his colleagues to stop counting their cash long enough to vote no on the Bush/Obama tax cuts for billionaires. It's like hearing an obituary for the American dream - at least the one we're all supposed to live in - as opposed to the one that the wealthiest 2% get to live in. Sad, but worth listening to (Sanders' speech, not necessarily my mediascape).}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25561=Keep your ears tuned to the dial 90.7 FM Portland or on-line at K-B-O-O dot F-M for a chance to win a pair of tickets.

Just back from Serbia, The Petrojvic Blasting Company have burnt venues to the ground across Europe and North America with their fiery young take on Balkan gypsy music.
