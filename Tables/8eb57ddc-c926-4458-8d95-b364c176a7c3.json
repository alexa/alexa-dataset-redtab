To hear it from the people I know, mediums are a hotter commodity than the Prada bowling bag\u201d (La Ferla 2000)., 15572=In July 2000, The Sci Fi Channel premiered Crossing Over with John Edward. The typical format for the half-hour program features fast-talking Edward in a darkened amphitheater, surrounded by risers packed with audience members. As various investigators have observed, Edward walks around the enclosure, pointing his attention to different sections of 20 or so audience members at a time, throwing out fast successions of general and random statements like \u201cI\u2019m getting something about a George over here. I don\u2019t know what this means. George could be someone who passed over, he could be someone here, he could be someone that you know,\u201d and then turning to focus on individuals that respond to Edward\u2019s guesswork by nodding their heads, breaking out in tears, or raising their hands in excitement (Shermer 2001)., 2646=With Jaroff\u2019s article appearing in Time magazine, the stage was set for the March 6 edition of CNN\u2019s Larry King Live. Host Larry King has long been a promoter of psychic mediums, in recent years providing hour-long platforms for both James Van Praagh and Sylvia Browne.

For example, after an increase in both print and television attention in July 2000, One Last Time appeared on the New York Times bestseller list for the first time. Later, after a major media blitz during the month of November, including appearances by Edward on NBC\u2019s Today Show, CBS\u2019 This Morning, and NBC Dateline, One Last Time jumped for the month of December to its highest best-seller position to date.

Balles Prize in Critical Thinking, to be presented by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry at the CFI Summit in October., 14246=Part of Edward\u2019s current success may be attributable to an apparent increase in public fascination with spirit communication over the past several years. A Gallup survey conducted in 1996 indicated that 20% of Americans believe that it is possible to communicate with the dead, while another 23% are unsure about the possibility. There is a significant gender difference on the topic, with 24% of women indicating belief in comparison to 16% of men. There are also differences across religious affiliations, as 27% of Catholics believe in spirit communication in comparison to 16% of Protestants and 9% of Jews (Gallup 1996)., 1477=The line-up of guests and the ultimate format for the March Larry King Live program was subtly stacked against criticism of Edward. In his Los Angeles studio, King sat at his desk with Van Praagh and Browne, while Edward was interviewed via satellite hook-up from the CNN studio in New York City. Jaroff appeared via satellite from Boca Raton, while CSICOP chair and philosopher Paul Kurtz was interviewed via feed originating from Buffalo, New York. On satellite from London, England, the panel also included Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, author of various self-help books including Kosher Sex : A Recipe for Passion and Intimacy, and the forthcoming The Psychic and the Rabbi: A Remarkable Correspondence , co-authored with psychic Uri Geller and spiritual guru Deepak Chopra., 13609=\"Without a doubt, visiting spirit mediums is becoming amazingly popular,\u201d author Cathy Cash Spellman told the New York Times last October (La Ferla 2000). Spellman\u2019s novel Bless the Child, about a girl with psychic abilities, was released as a film with the same title by Paramount this past fall. Panned by critics, the film grossed a disappointing $30 million. Bless the Child, however, was the second major film featuring psychic mediums over the past two years. Walt Disney\u2019s Sixth Sense, starring Bruce Willis as a child psychologist who administers to a boy traumatized by visions of dead people, grossed an extraordinary $300 million in 1999., 18499=June 14, 2013, 5421=Jaroff is one of America\u2019 senior science journalists. Named Time magazine\u2019s chief science reporter in 1969, Jaroff has won numerous awards for coverage ranging from space exploration to anthropology. In 1980, Jaroff became the founding managing editor of Discover magazine, and like many science writers of his generation, he exhibits in his reporting a strong enthusiasm and appreciation for the scientific paradigm. A long time fellow of CSICOP and friend of magician James Randi, Jaroff has reported on several controversies related to the paranormal and the pseudoscientific, including Randi\u2019s efforts to expose psychic Uri Geller., 20498=The May/June 2015 Skeptical Inquirer, 19227=December 5, 2014, 6094=Enter veteran science writer Leon Jaroff. \u201cClairvoyants who claim to communicate with the dead\u2014and warnings not to listen to them\u2014go back at least as far as the Old Testament, yet psychics continue to flourish in back parlors and storefronts across America,\u201d wrote Jaroff in his lead to a March 6 Time magazine feature. \u201cNone today is better known or more listened to than John Edward, a fast-talking former ballroom-dancing instructor who is cleaning up on his proclaimed ability \u2018to connect with energies of people who have crossed over.\u2019 Died, that is\u201d (Jaroff 2001)., 18900=July 3, 2013}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{15937=Matthew C.

Shared publishers among Edward, Van Praagh, Browne, and Boteach. Boteach appeared on the program supposedly to present criticism from the perspective of a traditional religious leader, while Van Praagh and Browne were framed by King as an unbiased jury of Edward\u2019s \u201cpsychic\u201d peers, able to objectively attest to the legitimacy of Edward\u2019s abilities. In reality, however, all three individuals have economic ties to Edward\u2019s success, as they all share a book publisher with Edward. Table 1 outlines the publishing links between Edward, Van Praagh, Browne, and Boteach.

Besides Larry King\u2019s preference for all things psychic, other factors likely contributed to the decision to air a special program on Edward.

Making a cameo appearance on the program was physicist Dale Graff, author of two books recounting his version of the CIA\u2019s attempt to use psychic \u201cremote viewing\u201d for spy purposes. Also appearing in a cameo role was Cliff Van Sant, a former FBI profiler able to offer first-hand familiarity with Bureau and police agency use of psychics to assist in crime solving. Throughout the hour-long program, the in-studio, \u201cstage center\u201d presence of Browne and Van Praagh allowed the duo to dominate the program\u2019s dialogue. Both psychics took turns interrupting other guest\u2019s comments or reframing responses. Van Praagh appeared well-coached and practiced in his comments, while Browne, with a seat next to King, was able to maintain a visible screen presence throughout the program, often lowering her head as if in meditation, or frequently closing her eyes, cultivating a persona of mysticism for the studio cameras. Larry King played the role of stage master, carefully controlling and managing commentary from Kurtz, Jaroff, and Boteach. If Van Praagh and Browne were stage center on Larry King Live, the other guests, including Edward, were side stage shows only to be revealed when King directed questions their way. In order to measure the \u201ctalk time\u201d allocated each guest, I analyzed the full text of the transcript of the television program using CATPAC, a software package developed by communication researchers at the State University of New York at Buffalo for use in quantitative content analysis.
