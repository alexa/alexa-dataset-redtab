Summers can be moderately warm (up to 30 degrees Celsius), even in northern areas, but only for limited periods. The length of the winter and amount of snow varies around the country. In the north there is more snow and winters are dark; on the southern and western coasts, winters are moderate and rainy, while further inland the temperature can get below -25 degrees Celsius. March, April, October and November tend to be the rainiest months.
