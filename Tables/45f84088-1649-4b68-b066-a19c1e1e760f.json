Perhaps being the third strongest, it won't be too difficult to handle alone?", "Darrow2 - #35 Cutting back to Paula, we discover that the trio managed to get separated in the mines. With Jeff cutting ahead and Ness horrible at following directions, this is going to be quite a trip. Oh, also, Paula set a snake on fire. Yay!", "Darrow2 - #36 Cutting to Ness, we find that he and Reginald still do not get along all that well. However, all those years of pitching gave Ness quite an arm. Just wait until after this is all over and he goes back to little league.", "Darrow2 - #37 The ultimate battle. Mole vs Chicken. Unfortunately, the match is interrupted before it can begin. However, it appears Ness has finally discovered the third strongest mole.
