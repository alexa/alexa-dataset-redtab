Frontman Max McElligott has carefully crafted some next-level indie pop, but credit also goes to producer extraordinaire Dave Fridmann, who's worked with the aforementioned bands. It\u2019s easy to draw comparisons between Londoner McElligott and early Elvis Costello after hearing the pop gem \u201cSomething Unusual,\u201d where pub-rock subtleties pepper the vocal melody under shimmering, synthesizer-based instrumentation and near-danceable grooves. With its captivating balance of restrained grip and erupting glamour, \u201cStay and Defend\u201d bobs and weaves on a strain of \u201cDavid DNA\u201d that\u2019s equal parts Byrne and Bowie. The orchestral approach to the title track's moody melody may garner comparisons to Lana Del Rey\u2019s \u201cVideo Games,\u201d but McElligott follows this with a diametric dose of disco-glam that\u2019s nearly impossible to hear without moving your feet. \u201cPlanets\u201d is a triumphant ballad, serving as a reminder that a good album should close epically.
