Slade effectively renders every past Slade hits collection redundant, as remastered sound and a sharp eye for all the band's U.K. chart entries serve up a peerless examination of what remains one of British rock's most flawless careers. No matter that the hits went so badly off the boil around 1975-1976 \u2014 still, three-quarters of disc one is nonstop solid gold and the remainder of the set isn't far behind, as Slade's mid-'80s renaissance delivers further smashes \"My Oh My\" and \"Run Run Away.\" Which would be hits enough for anybody, but the fun doesn't end there. A bonus second disc then digs into the darker recesses of the Top 75 to pull out the band's lesser successes, a mixed bag that runs from \"All Join Hands\" to \"Ruby Red,\" the 1980 live version of \"Born to Be Wild,\" \"Gypsy Roadhog,\" \"C'Est la Vie,\" and more. It's not a complete guide to Slade on 45 (there's no \"Give Us a Goal,\" for a start), but it comes close enough.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:25:20 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "View In iTunes Sladest 5.
