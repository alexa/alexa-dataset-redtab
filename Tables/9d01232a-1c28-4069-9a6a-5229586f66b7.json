In the world of music you do not have to be a native to express the beauty in a favourite location: the saying \u0093the onlooker sees more of the game\u0094 sums it all up quite well. The first four tracks visit the home countries of the British Isles, before setting out for a varied selection of melodies either created in the places they salute, or else written and performed from far away as tributes to places worshipped from afar. With names such as Robert Farnon, George Melachrino, Mantovani, Michel Legrand and David Rose involved the result has to be a most satisfying and nostalgic musical tour. 06.11.2009 Release Date: CD\u00a0 Medium: //--> window.document.write(ausgabe); var ausgabe = rund.toString(); var rund = erg.toFixed(2); var erg = \u00a0 Units", "textAfterTable": "Similar CD's ... is empty.
