Please see the files README (general description, installation), clisp.man (command line switches, tooltypes, explanation of files) and impnotes.(txt|html) (differences between CLISP and the Common Lisp reference, extensions, ARexx interface documentation). See also CHANGES.LOG if you are not a new user. Aminet archive names have been shortened to fit the 20 characters limit. Which version to choose ----------------------- There may be five distinct binary versions of CLISP. These will be referred as *-typ2, *-high, *-low, *-00 and *-wide. You'll not be able to run all of them on one machine. The *-high, *-low and *-wide versions are of historical interest now that the *-typ2 version exists that could even be compiled for 68000, thus running on every Amiga (great!). o The *-typ2 version: + has been compiled for 68020 and higher, won't run on 68000 CPUs. It doesn't use the floating point coprocessor. + is able to deal with addresses from 0 to 0x7FFFFFFF, thus working on almost any system (anyone with memory above $80000000?) and with VMM. o The *-high version: + has been compiled for 68020 and higher, won't run on 68000 CPUs. It doesn't use the floating point coprocessor. + is able to deal with addresses from 0 to 0x07FFFFFF, thus working on most A3000 and A4000 machines. GigaMem uses addresses between 0x20000000 and", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
