If you've never heard of any of those bands then you will find this album is incredibly accessible; instrumental music full of emotion but without some of the more \"out there\" elements found in some other post-rock bands. The music ranges from mellow to heavy and is incredibly poweful throughout. I can guarantee pretty much anyone who enjoys music in general will love this album. For six bucks Young Mountain is definitely worth it. Buy it now, you won't regret it. Great Original Post-Rock \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Dacres This album is full of amazing music. Though there are only 6 songs, most of them are substantial in length. There's really two types of post-rock: the hazy/foggy/quiet light drums type sound, and the clearer/louder, ocean of sound", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
