Born a dozen years too late, the group were condemned to the corners of the indie scene and the edges of the U.S. charts, virtually neglected by the American rock masses that were their natural audience. At least the U.K. indie kids took them to heart, but Big Fun City deserved so much more than that. Having shaken off their cobwebs on Blue Sisters Swing, Flesh came to NYC (thus the new album's title) to record with producer Craig Leon. A less sympathetic producer would have destroyed this record, either by foisting a thoroughly '80s slickness into the mix, or lazily permitting the group's retro sound to run rampant. Instead, Leon respected the group's vision, creating a modern album that remains a tribute to rock's rich past. A motherlode of riffs are the song's sturdy foundation blocks, mostly mined from a rich R&B vein. The Stones are an obvious influence, although Flesh never plunder directly, instead creating the best riffs Keith Richards never played. Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground also played a major role in the members' youths, while C&W and the blues continued to make welcome appearances. Thus the band", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
