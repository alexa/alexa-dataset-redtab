The theme/ prompt was \"What if there was a blizzard in Summers?\". Here, I figured, if there was a blizzard in Summers, why not go all the way and have a major freeze, even extending out to the surrounding waters?

Having recently read the Alex Ross masterpiece \"Marvels\", I'd REALLY loved how he painted Cyclops's visor and tried to borrow a bit of that from memory, here. This is one of my favorite pieces of mine to date, just because it's fairly simple, yet I feel, so very effective.", "There it is!
