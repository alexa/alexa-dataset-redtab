Windy & Carl's brand of space-rock borrows from subliminal style of the shoegaze scene \u2014 witness Windy Weber's hushed vocals on the shimmering opener \"Btwn You + Me,\" and the overflowing layers of lush guitar feedback on hypnotic songs like \"La Douleur\" and \"Snow Covers Everything.\" Watery\u00a0guitar echoes course through the icy \"My Love,\" recalling the 1995 Slowdive dream-pop classic Pygmalion. Similarly, \"Rhodes\" oscillates with tape loops of My Bloody Valentine-style guitars, creating a beautiful soundscape of noise not heard since Seefeel\u2019s Mark Van Hoen collaborated with Neil Halstead for Slowdive's 1993 5EP. The distortion grows meatier on \"When We Were,\" droning and howling at times like the first two Flying Saucer Attack albums. Throughout Songs for the Broken Hearted, Windy & Carl continue to push avant-noise compositions into deeper, darker and unexpectedly beautiful realms without succumbing to gothic melodrama., 25688=Formed: 1991 in Dearborn, MI, 124614=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
