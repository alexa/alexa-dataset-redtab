I can help you by providing ways to adapt homework assignments, providing information on ways to help your child with their trouble areas, and giving tips on getting through the work. I can help your child with work in the same way. This is all done in real time (like a chat room) so you get immediate feedback. $20.00 an hour. If you are interested please email me so we can set up a time. I use the website tutor.com so I need to know when to log into it and tell you how to go through the process to get tutoring. I can also provide more in depth counseling than I do here or in email and advice about your child's difficulties and give some feedback on issues to address in annual IEP meetings.", ""]], "pageTitle": "TutoringConsulting Help Available Online | LD OnLine", "title": "", "url": "http://www.ldonline.org/xarbb/topic/5285", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988458.74/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00101-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 555418632, "recordOffset": 555410430, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{11563=\u00a92015 WETA.
