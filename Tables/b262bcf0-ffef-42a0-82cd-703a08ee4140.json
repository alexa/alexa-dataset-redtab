As another reviewer said before, the score had to be shortened, but this is a great soundtrack. Best songs: If I Loved You, June Is Bustin' Out All Over, and Waltz Suite: \"Carousel\". The only thing I would've changed about this album is to split up some of the songs that were combined (The Highest Judge of All and You'll Never Walk Alone - GREAT SONG!) Still, great album, great show. I recommend getting the DVD too! With a lot of musicals, you can never go wrong getting both the DVD and the soundtrack., 27997=This is a WONDERFUL album - It is the original movie recording starring John Raitt, Jan Clayton, and Jean Darling. John Raitt, especially, is amazing - his voice is so beautiful - as are the voices of all the others. I would fully reccomend this album to anyone who appreciates classic musicals., 26453=Though the score had to be radically shortened to fit on ten 12\" sides of a 78 rpm record album, this 1945 original cast recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest show, remains the gold standard by which all subsequent recordings of the score must be judged. John Raitt and Jan Clayton have yet to be equalled as Billy Bigelow and Julie Jordan; and Jean Darling and Eric Mattson match them every step of the way as Carrie Pipperidge and Mister Snow. If you're taking the trouble to read this review I can only assume that you're already familiar with this music; however, if you're not, I would like to say that CAROUSEL represents the pinnacle of the romantic musical play--a theatrical form virtually invented by the composer-lyricist-librettist team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2nd. If classic musical theater is your pleasure, then this recording is a must., 110441=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
