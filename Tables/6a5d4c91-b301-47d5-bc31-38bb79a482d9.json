Like the Temptations, they use both a gruff, baritone lead (\"Holding On\") and a high tenor (\"Trust Me\") in call-and-response arrangements. But they are intent upon bringing their listeners to Jesus Christ rather than romantic fulfillment. \"Time Has Made a Change\" has a country flavor to accompany its message decrying a loss of the old ways of doing things. For the most part, however, the Soul Seekers want to praise the Lord, as titles like \"He Rose\" and \"It's All God\" indicate. They are at their most soulful and stripped down on the closer, \"Take Your Burdens,\" which begins with just a simple electric guitar accompaniment, focusing on the group harmonies, then builds. A live audience can barely be heard in the background, but they seem to be enjoying the Soul Seekers' performances as much as CD listeners are likely to.
