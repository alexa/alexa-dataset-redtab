The NY-based spinner got his start peddling mixtapes on the streets. A few years later, his album The Professional, Pt. 2 hit the Billboard Top Ten album chart. Looking at the list of artists on Clue?'s play list, it's easy to see why the album has had such success. This time out, Clue? enlisted the likes of Jay-Z, DMX, Beanie Sigel, Redman, Nas, Foxy Brown, Trick Daddy, and Eminem among many others. What is likely to draw the attention of hip-hop fans are the exclusive tracks on the album, including \"Change the Game (Remix),\" which mixes artists from both coasts such as tha Dogg Pound, Jay-Z, Beanie Sigel, and Memphis Bleek.
