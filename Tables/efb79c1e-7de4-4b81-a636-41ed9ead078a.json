The band, known for its doom metal riffs and sacrilegious (in a fun way) stage attire, actually makes their genre, scary to outsiders, as accessible as anyone. \u201cInfestissumam Per Aspera Part 2\u201d has chuggin\u2019 riffs and creepy, breathy vocals, but lead singer Papa Emeritus II (LOL) actually has a really nice voice, making lyrics like \u201cSatan devours all\u201d go down a lot easier than some of their screamier brethren (to be fair, the song also features perhaps misleading lyrics like \u201call your dreams will come true\u201d). Because the music isn\u2019t terribly over-the-top or prohibitively complex, their anti-religious lyricism actually has a more profound effect than scaring the living daylights out of people \u2014 \u201cyou know that the fog is here\u201d they sing on \u201cSecular Haze\u201d over Anton Lavey-esque organs. As much as anything, the band channels forefathers of metal like Blue Oyster Cult and Black Sabbath, especially on songs like \u201cGiggalo,\u201d and they\u2019ve got a nice ear for melody \u2014 even as \u201cGhuleh\u201d begins with creepy whispers and ventures into dark territory lyrically, it\u2019s a piano-laden power ballad sung sweetly. Fans of melodic metal who don\u2019t mind the darker stuff lyrically will flock to\u00a0Infestissumam\u00a0like lambs to the slaughter. 04/15/2013 Amoeba Review", "textAfterTable": "Side B Titles Artist Length 1.
