The sexy lady in the black dress finally appears. However, unlike the Runaway Five, she actually reads contracts, so no need to save her.", "Darrow2 - #46 Lucky and Gorgeous are quite the hit with the ladies, especially when they show off their dance moves. Venus, however, isn't the type to be won over so easily.", "Darrow2 - #47 With the show wrapping up, the Runaway Five throw caution to the wind and...drive straight through the wall. Take that, manager lady! ...But seriously, kids, don't drive through walls unless you're drunk and have no control, or have some form of OCD that forces you to drive through several walls per day. This comic cares deeply for your well being, you see.", "Darrow2 - #48 With the show over, Ness gets around to perhaps the most important task in the story. Also, stink lines are seriously dangerous. If you ever see stink lines coming at you, run the other way, man.", "Darrow2 - #49 While she's all smiles at first glance, the elevator operator deep down resents and hates most males. You can only deal with so much sexual harassment from dirty old businessmen before something snaps. Some even say this is what truly changed Giyas as well. ...Well, okay, only one guys says it. And he's kind of crazy, but still."], ["Date", "8/23/09", "8/23/09", "8/23/09", "8/23/09", "8/23/09"], ["Rank", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00"]], "pageTitle": "STARMEN.NET - EarthBound / Mother 3 Goodness.", "title": "", "url": "http://starmen.net/vote/vote.php?id=24556&stuffPageNumber=36", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988458.74/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00154-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 228527223, "recordOffset": 228512647, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "textBeforeTable": "> T P M G F B A < Other Submissions by Darrow The follow-up to Flapbound!
