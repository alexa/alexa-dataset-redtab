This one was all about goofing around and experimenting with shades of green to give the Manly Fish some texture. I didn't pull off a \"scaly\" look as much as I'd been hoping, but I think it sort of emulates markings on some fish, like a speckled trout a bit, which I figured to be kinda cool. I also liked the idea of making his arms into prehensile fins.", "I'm stronger than my little punk brother!!", "Based on those crazy Japanese comics that i can no longer find a working link to.
