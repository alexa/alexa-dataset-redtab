Ably summoning the spirit of the age of Cerrone and Charlie's Angels, Sinclar proved himself a solid producer despite the lack of freshness, adding in plenty of swooping strings, nickel-bag guitars, and soft-toned keyboards. \"Got to Be Free\" and \"Darlin'\" (featuring ex-D-Train vocalist James \"D-Train\" Williams) are a pair of disco-mover productions that wouldn't sound out of place on classic American R&B radio, and Sinclar has plenty of fun throughout the LP. Biography Born: 1967 in Paris, France Genre: Dance Years Active: '90s, '00s, '10s The man behind such productions as the Mighty Bop (downtempo hip-hop), Bob Sinclar (house), and R\u00e9miniscence Quartet (acid jazz) is Chris the French Kiss (aka Christophe le Friant), a Parisian DJ and head of the crucial French label Yellow Productions as well as a producer. Le Friant began DJing in 1987 while still a teenager, and formed Yellow Productions in 1993 with Alain Ho.
