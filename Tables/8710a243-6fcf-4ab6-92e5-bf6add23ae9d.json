The set list consists of song from Cohen\u2019s 40-year-career ranging from his most well known compositions to lost album tracks. Cohen has a top-notch band supporting him for this performance and they bring a fresh and soulful vibe to the song arrangements. Cohen himself sounds reinvigorated, feeding off the enraptured crowd; he sings his lyrics with a fiery passion. Leonard Cohen is a saint, get this album and be blessed by him.
