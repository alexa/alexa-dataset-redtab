Beginning with a trio of tunes from 1958's Emarcy Small Group Sessions, the set moves on to include Adderly in quintet and larger group configurations, and even a trio of sides from his sessions backed by a string orchestra playing ballads. Adderly was the next logical step after Charlie \"Bird\" Parker, and his alto sax work was second to none, utilizing Bird's style and mixing it up with healthy doses from Johnny Hodges and Benny Carter to create his own potent style.
