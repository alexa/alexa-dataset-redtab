More recently, New Zealand voted in its first female prime minister in 1997. Jenny Shipley held office for two years, before handing over to another female leader - Helen Clarke, who continued to lead until 2008. In the last ten years, New Zealand has enjoyed a surge in tourism, partly due to the wealth of wineries, ski fields and nature reserves. The film industry has also been a great champion of New Zealand, with filmmakers enjoying the rugged terrain and relatively cheap costs associated with filming in New Zealand. The Lord of the Rings franchise is probably the most well known film to be shot in New Zealand, and has been largely responsible for putting New Zealand in the international spotlight. A devastating earthquake hit Christchurch in 2011, resulting in widespread loss of life and infrastructure. Although Christchurch is still rebuilding, visitors are encouraged to visit this spirited city., 49950=The most pleasant time for travelling throughout New Zealand is summer (December to February); however, this is also the busiest period, especially during school holidays (late December to late January).

After the devastating earthquake of 2011, Christchurch is in rebuilding mode - but the festival is still going ahead in 2012. The best thing about this festival? It\u2019s free!, 60801=Maori tribes, descended from Polynesia, lived in New Zealand for centuries before the arrival of Europeans in the 18th century. Relying on fishing, hunting and foraging, these people were able to live off the land and develop a deep connection with the earth as a result of this. European settlers caused wide-scale disruption and land loss for the Maoris, which resulted in conflict and displacement in the early days of colonisation. The 1840 Treaty of Waitangi officially recognised Maori land ownership, of which the British and Maoris were signatories. This historic agreement is viewed as a pivotal moment in New Zealand\u2019s history and the first important step towards reconciliation between the original inhabitants and settlers., 70544=This national public holiday celebrates the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.
