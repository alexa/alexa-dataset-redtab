Spanish explorers were drawn to the land and fascinated by the proliferation of gold. The myth of El Dorado soon abounded, and the search for this land of gold soon became an obsession. From the creation of Santa Marta in 1525, colonisation spread rapidly throughout the rest of the country, leading to interest from neighbouring countries that were also keen to exploit Colombia\u2019s natural resources. Many Africans soon started to arrive as a part of the slave trade, and provided a much-needed labour force for the colonisers. Life was tough for the slaves; however, African song, dance and other afro-traditions helped to shape Colombian culture well into the future., 42351=There is always a good time to visit Colombia, as the seasons vary throughout the country. While the climate generally remains constant throughout the year, the temperature can change depending on where you are. In the far north, the climate is usually tropical, warm and humid; while central Colombia can get quite cool - Bogota is known for its mild temperatures, particularly at night. The wet season is roughly from March to May and September to November, although this varies around the country. December to March is the peak travel period due to the dry conditions and holidays and festivals that proliferate across the country. During this time, expect more sunshine, but also more people competing for space in the cities and tourist regions., 56233=Known locally at the \u2018Capital of Heaven\u2019, Cali\u2019s museums and public art may dazzle you, but it\u2019s the up and coming food and party scene that\u2019s getting loads of attention. With modern restaurants serving international cuisine, local eateries offering traditional fare, lively salsa bars open until dawn and a fair worth travelling for in late December, Cali shouldn\u2019t be missed!, 52591=Independence from Spain rose to the top of Colombia\u2019s agenda after years of resentment. Simon Bolivar soon became a local hero, fighting for independence from the Spaniards. It took many years but in 1819, Colombia was granted its freedom \u2013 Bolivar had fought his way into the minds and hearts of Colombia, where he is still revered. However, this spirit of freedom was short lived as Colombia descended into confrontation and civil war in the following years. Colombia seemed to be at the mercy of political opponents and guerrilla groups, weaving between periods of peace and extreme violence. By the 1970s, Colombia had a new wave of criminal activity stemming from the lucrative cocaine trade. Pablo Escobar became one of the world\u2019s most notorious (and wealthy) criminals by controlling most of the world\u2019s drug trade. Colombia became a dangerous place to live (and travel in) during this period, yet has recently emerged victorious from these dark days. With vastly improved national security and a growing economy based on agriculture, textiles and mineral mining, Colombia is welcoming back tourists with open arms., 64474=See magical Medellin in full bloom every August, when this enchanting city\u2019s balconies, gardens, terraces and courtyards burst into a symphony of floral wonders. With live music, classic cars, beauty pageants, dog shows, afro-inspired dance and flower exhibitions all competing for attention during this traditional festival, this is Medellin at its very best.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading 9.
