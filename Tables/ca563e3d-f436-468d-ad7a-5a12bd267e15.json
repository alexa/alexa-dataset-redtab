But here in the States we got an EP with songs from their debut album, and the new track \"The Club is Alive\" So I highly recommend buying this EP, if you don't want to do that, then make sure you buy \"The Club is Alive\" because the track is a hot summer anthem :) Support JLS ;) whoop whoop!! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by loveneverfails they sound amazingg!!!!!! they are great i love all of these songs!!!! you should get this song fo sho!!! haha About Time!", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
