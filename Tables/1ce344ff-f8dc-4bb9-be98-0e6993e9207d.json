Do sign up for posts by email, or follow\u00a0me on Twitter\u00a0for new & old posts, plus a bunch of other nonsense., 27232=The first two reasons are\u00a0easy to see in\u00a0the overall numbers.\u00a02014 was a big year: 1.5x more miles than 2013, and over 5x more than 2012.\u00a0In 2014 I did my first marathon (Manchester, 6 April), and then the\u00a0Monster Month\u00a0\u2013 which comprised\u00a0six half marathons on six consecutive weekends\u00a0(1 training run, 4\u00a0half marathon races and 1 Tough Mudder, September-October)., 27773=February 2014 is certainly an outlier.

But I suspect that it really is the biggest because when I checked the monthly\u00a0circulation figures for other big magazines, they\u2019re much much smaller. Here\u2019s the top\u00a0five in the US: The Watchtower: Public Edition, which has been produced and distributed by Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses since 1879, now has an average monthly print run of 53m copies.

The\u00a0biggest magazine in India (Mathrubhoomi) records a circulation of 800k. I couldn\u2019t find any data for China \u2013 perhaps there is a huge magazine there of which I\u2019m not aware (please let me know if so). But top magazine circulation does not correspond to population size. For example: the Netherlands\u2019 top magazine is AutoPrimeurs\u00a0with 6m\u00a0among a population of 16.8, whereas\u00a0Cosmopolitan\u00a0in Russia circulates 980k\u00a0copies among a population of 144m. Curiously, different magazine\u00a0topics\u00a0top the list in different countries: Cooking \u2013\u00a0Canada TV \u2013 France Cars \u2013 Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand Celebrities \u2013 Russia, Spain In other countries, there are either more general, or organisation-specific magazines topping the list: Australian Women\u2019s Weekly \u2013 well, Australia The National Trust Magazine \u2013 UK AARP The Magazine \u2013 US So, how did The Watchtower\u2019s circulation get so big? For sure there is a sense of mission \u2013 the subtitle of the magazine is \u2018Announcing God\u2019s Kingdom\u2019. Second, it\u2019s free. Until 1990,\u00a0The Watchtower\u00a0carried a fee of\u00a0$0.25 in the US. After a\u00a0question was raised over the whether religious literature should\u00a0be subject to taxation, the decision was made to make the magazine free, and now it is funded by\u00a0voluntary donations from\u00a0Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and members of the public. Third, it\u2019s efficient. Production of so many copies must be very expensive. But distribution is relatively cheap, since at local\u00a0level", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
