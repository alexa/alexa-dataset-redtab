All his works evoke a strong sense of beauty, magnificence, transcendence and worship. I really appreciate the timelessness of the music. Some parts are quite modal; others make use of modern seventh chords or tone clusters. The deceptive simplicity of the music really appeals to me. A few well-placed and beautiful chords make an entire movement divine. The litanies in particular are very moving. While very simple, the change in vocal register and texture is very effective.
