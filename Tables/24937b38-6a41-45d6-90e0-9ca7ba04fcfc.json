Peter's Go is a good one for improvers as it has different board sizes. Also worth a mention are GnuGo, Minimago and TurboGo.

If you can afford it, buy Many Faces of Go with its considerable tutorial material. One way to improve your Go may be to play against a computer program. If you are a beginner, almost any program will do for this. However, as you improve, you will find that playing a program of around your own strength does not necessarily improve your Go - it may make it worse: instead of learning good style, you just learn to play the particular moves which that program is unable to handle.", "textAfterTable": "This site has reviews of many of the above programs.
