This lady's voice and stylings are fantastic and I haven't even heard a whole song. I've never bought an album done entirely in another language that I don't even speak. Wonderful \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by XxCrazyGurlxX Her voice is Beautiful and Calming and her words are incredible, powerful, and meaningful. any song on here is a GREAT BUY.
