First off, there's the second single \"Les Playboys\" where Dutronc mocks stereotypical womanizers with a swaggering flair, pointing out his own seduction tactics for women in the process. (Upon recognizing the impenetrably thick layers of irony, his belle Fran\u00e7oise Hardy probably more than agreed to the lyrics.) The African chant of \"La Compadade\" visits the same territory as Gainsbourg Percussions did two years earlier. Finally, third single \"Les Cactus\" made its way into the renowned French dictionary Petit Robert as a synonym for people's everyday troubles.

To keep them apart, the first album is equally referred to by its original year of release (1966), the first song on the album (\"Les Playboys\") or either one of the title tunes to the preceding EPs (\"Les Playboys,\" \"Et Moi, et Moi, et Moi\" or \"Les Cactus\"), the content of which matches exactly with the 12 songs present here.], 25693=Born: 28 April 1943 in Paris, France, 123267=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc. \u039c\u03b5 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03be\u03b7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 04:51:20 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Open iTunes to preview, buy and download music.
