Kaikki oikeudet pid\u00e4tet\u00e4\u00e4n., 6497=Jazz Is Dead, one of America's premier jam bands, delivers their breakthrough recording with Great Sky River. Recorded \"live\" at the IMAC Theater in Huntington, NY, with Jimmy Herring on guitar, Alphonso Johnson on bass, T Lavitz on keyboards, and Rod Morgenstein on drums, the band plays a powerful, high-energy set that features their rock chops in all their jam band glory. Three extended jams \u2014 \"Estimated Prophet,\" \"St. Stephen/The Eleven,\" and \"Terrapin Station/Dark Star\" \u2014 form the heart and soul of the show and the band's true calling. Lovers of groove, electronica, and rock guitar pyrotechnics will find themselves ear deep in the guitar wizardry of Jimmy Herring on these jams. Absent is drummer Jeff Sipe, but Rod Morgenstein definitely holds down the rhythm section with an unreal and potent drum solo on \"St. Stephen/The Eleven.\" T Lavitz goes the distance and plays an intense set as does Alphonso Johnson, with his basslines speaking out as much more than an appendage to Lavitz's keyboards or Herring's guitar. Great Sky River exceeds the group's 1999 \"live\" release, Laughing Water: Wake of the Flood Revisited \u2014 which also explored and featured classic Grateful Dead compositions \u2014 because the performance was not altered or overdubbed. This CD is truly \"live\" and a cool 21st century representation of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter's ripe rock repertoire.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 04:30:45 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "View In iTunes Laughing Water 3.
