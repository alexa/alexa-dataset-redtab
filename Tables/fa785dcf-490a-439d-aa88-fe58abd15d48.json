Also known as the South Andean Deer, the Huemul is part of the Chilean Coat of Arms and is not only culturally, but also ecologically and economically of considerable value. It is the only large herbivore to inhabit sub-Antarctic Patagonia. However, the future of the Huemul is far from certain after suffering a 99% decline in population size and a 50% decline in its range. Today less than 1500 animals remain in small and fragmented populations, with the majority occurring in Chile. As a result the Huemul has been classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is listed under both CMS and CITES on Appendix I since 1997 and 1975 respectively., 5786=In order to conserve the last remaining Huemul populations and their habitats the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the Conservation of the Southern Huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) was concluded by Argentina and Chile under CMS auspices in 2010.
