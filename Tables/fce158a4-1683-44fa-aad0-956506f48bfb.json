Response to Intervention. I am wanting to see if parents of children with learning disabilities are aware of RiT? how did you learn about it, what sources if any do you have as parents to find out more information about RiT, if your child's school district uses it If you as a parent find it exicting or have concerns about RiT? I'm curious about the model because I am wondering if it could aid in helping children to receive services quicker or not. Thanks for your input and insight.", ""]], "pageTitle": "RiT or Response to Intervention | LD OnLine", "title": "", "url": "http://www.ldonline.org/xarbb/topic/15156", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988458.74/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00247-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 550826618, "recordOffset": 550818416, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{11667=About LD OnLine | Contact Us | LD Basics | ADHD Basics | Questions + Answers | Glossary | LD Topics Teaching Kids with LD | Home-to-School Connection | Kids' Voices | Expert Advice | LD Resources | Yellow Pages LearningStore | IDEA 2004 | Contributors | First Person | Newsletters | Calendar | En Espa\u00f1ol | Forums | How to Advertise, 11454=\u00a92015 WETA.
