But for the more explicit religious undertones of the lyrics, this collection is a standard Juan Luis Guerra and 440 release, a celebration of life set to the best and most joyful merengue and bachata music the world has to offer. First single \"En el Cielo No Hay Hospital'' quickly climbed up the Latin charts.
