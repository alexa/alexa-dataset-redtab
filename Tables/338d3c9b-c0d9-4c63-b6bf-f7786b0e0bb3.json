While still never playing live, it's easy to imagine many of the songs on Blood kicking out the jams live, especially since in the punk/new wave-crazy scenes of the times they would have cut a truly unique path. No matter how near to three-chord catchiness some of the numbers get, something about them always sounds just off enough. Edge maintains his usual mix of electronic weirdness \u2014 at this point he had the knack for never making his keyboards sound cheap or or cheesy, a good talent \u2014 whileCreed is all over the place as usual, his seemingly effortless but always fantastic soloing ripping through the songs. \"Perfumed Metal\" is one fantastic example of many, with both his strong rhythm crunch and his freeform work turning everything into one powercharged feedback frenzy. Another winner is the massive solo halfway through \"The Strangers\" \u2014 only a few seconds long, but better than most songs in their entirety. Meanwhile, Edge feeds his voice through effects processors and keeps on the strange lyrical path \u2014 thus, from \"Inner Vacume,\" this couplet: \"Buildings built like beaches/Dripping off the land.\" It's not all aliens from Mars or anything \u2014 often", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
