I played Halo 1 on the the PC years ago and was so SO offended by it I never bothered with the others. It was the console version of Doom except shittier and was superseded by PC franchises even at the time of its release.

I think its silly given how little is unique about the story, setting and whatnot but you can't argue with nostalgia. \u00a0 Playing: The Witcher 3 Watching: True Detective", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 3, "headerRowIndex": 0}
