XD) but it is a bit... unusual. I guess? So over the past week I visited the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for the first time. Now, before you jump to conclusions, I was completely facinated and it really was a treat and I live at the tip of the East Coast so I never get to see awesome stuff like this. While looking in some of the exhibits, I noticed the massive Saturn V (Five) Rocket, which had the power to bring things to orbit, and was the rocket used to launch all of the Apollo missions as well as the Space Shuttle missions. Being a MOTHER nerd, I thought of the 'Five can Ladder' quote, and kind of connected it to the Saturn Five rocket. I had a notebook in my paper, so over lunch, I sketched this out and went back to the exhibit in in EarthBound's honor, I took my drawing's photo next to a display of the rocket. :) So look at it this way, there was a MOTHER fan being a MOTHER fan in a space center! I also recreated a Space Shuttle and went even more EarthBoundy on it and renamed it 'Melody' and put 'Eagleland' in place of the 'United States' logo. I also mixed up the American flag a little and let's just say it's the Eagleland flag. I tried to make each Saturn look a little different as well! I used colored pencil on the shuttle, the Saturns, the plume of flame, and the planet as well. The background was done with markers.
