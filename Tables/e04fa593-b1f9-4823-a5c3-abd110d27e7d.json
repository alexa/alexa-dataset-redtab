Early demos from 1994 and 1995 saw the group complemented by bassist Chiron and keyboard player Aradia, but her services were soon dispensed with and it wasn't until the release of their 1997 debut album, Arma Christi, that Urgehal bothered to hire a human drummer, Uruz (real name Jarle Byberg). Further examples of raw, unsophisticated, misanthropic black metal followed in the shape of 1998's Massive Terrestrial Attack, 2001's Atomkinder, and 2003's Through Thick Fog Til Death, which introduced new bassist Tomas \"Sregroth\" Torgersbr\u00e5ten and was eventually reissued stateside two years later by Southern Lord Records, along with a new Urgehal release, Goat Craft Torment.
