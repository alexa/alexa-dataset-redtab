Unlike their friendlier labelmates Glass Candy, their catchiest songs are buried amongst extended Dario Argento soundtrack-style jams, and even then they\u2019re delivered with such a cool demeanor, you\u2019re the one who has to reach out to connect to these songs. Thank God, cause Kill For Love\u2019s nighttime mystique and seedy club jams keep me coming back and uncovering something new every time.
