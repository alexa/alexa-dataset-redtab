One is fingerpicker music \u2014 that is, acoustic folk-rock guitarists like Leo Kottke, John Fahey, Peter Lang, Michael Gulezian, Stefan Grossman, and Robbie Basho. Another is the Steve Vai/Joe Satriani/Randy Coven school of electric hard rock shredders \u2014 flamboyant, ostentatious, high-voltage axemen with a hell-bent-for-chops virtuosity. And there is also '60s surf guitar. So where does guitar-playing instrumentalist Rich Stein fit in? Actually, Unspoken cannot really be lumped in with any of those three guitar schools. The guitar playing that Stein offers on this CD is neither surf rock nor hard rock, and even though one hears some of that Fahey/Kottke/Lang influence in his folk-rock approach, Stein is not a true picker, either. Stein moves back and forth between acoustic and electric guitar on this CD, and a real picker would not be playing so much electric guitar \u2014 the acoustic guitar is the instrument that makes authentic picker music what it is. So when all is said and done, Unspoken manages to bring something that is fairly fresh-sounding to instrumental folk-rock guitar music \u2014 something that is picker-influenced but is not true state-of-the-art picker music, either (certainly not if one is an acoustic purist when it comes to that style).
