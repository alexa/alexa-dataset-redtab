Unless I'm mistaken and it actually has that. It doesn't, and collisions totally wouldn't work in TrackMania. The main purpose of the game is to achieve the fastest times, not to get in eachother's way. The roads aren't wide enough to allow for overtaking either. If you want collisions, most other racing games fit the bill, but TrackMania isn't and never was that kind of game. \u00a0 \u00a0", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 3, "headerRowIndex": 0}
