Another one of my favorite pieces, mostly because it's so close to what was in my mind before my digital pen touched my Wacom tablet. Maybe it's just my neuropsychology background at work, but I thought that the Cerebrum to be one of the cooler, more fitting of the \"campy\" enemy ideas in EB0. I mean, he's a brain, on a glass-domed platter with legs sticking out the bottom! How awesome is that! The legs on the original didn't look quite so human, so I decided to have them look human-ish, but not quite.", "\"Handsomely Handsome Puppet\". I'm a big fan of Threed's Handsome Tom. Sure, it was merely an alternate palette version of Smilin' Sam, but come ON! He's a puppet/ dummy that has purple skin and white hair. How creepy is THAT? And how creepy is the person who'd have made him? Handsome Tom is cool.", "There's something undeniably creepy about the Ghost of Starman, what with that glowing aura around the dark palette of its body. Having recently read the Alex Ross masterpiece \"Marvels\", I'd REALLY loved how he painted Cyclops's visor and tried to borrow a bit of that from memory, here. This is one of my favorite pieces of mine to date, just because it's fairly simple, yet I feel, so very effective.", "A Smilin' Sphere. :) Inspired by and background palette based on a watercolour piece by HawkeyeHayes.", "Colored version of an old Ness sketch."], ["Date", "4/26/05", "4/26/05", "4/26/05", "4/26/05", "4/26/05"], ["Rank", "8.58", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00"]], "pageTitle": "STARMEN.NET - EarthBound / Mother 3 Goodness.", "title": "", "url": "http://starmen.net/vote/vote.php?id=22108&stuff=DateASC&stuffPageNumber=7", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988458.74/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00023-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 230530585, "recordOffset": 230522383, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "textBeforeTable": "> 1 < Other Submissions by ozwalled Made with Creature Editor 3.0, a piece of software that was made before the Spore Creature Creator was released, as a 2D mock-up of it.
