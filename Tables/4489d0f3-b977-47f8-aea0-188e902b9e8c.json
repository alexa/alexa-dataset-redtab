The summer months between December and February can be hot and humid, bringing temperatures to the high 30s \u2013 perfect weather to enjoy Brazil\u2019s famous beaches. It\u2019s also festival season, so it\u2019s well worth visiting during this time. Rainfall varies greatly around Brazil so depending on where you\u2019re travelling, you could experience some rain. Around the Pantanal, Manaus and the Amazon basin, expect patches of rain all year round. Rio and the areas around Foz de Iguacu don\u2019t have distinct rainy seasons and are typically drier than some other areas of Brazil. The south of Brazil experiences extreme seasonal changes, so pack accordingly., 12706=Indigenous tribes inhabited Brazil for centuries before the arrival of the first European settlers from Portugal in the 1500s. Colonisation brought agriculture and crop growing to Brazil, resulting in extensive land clearing which dispossessed much of the indigenous population. The growing of sugar cane resulted in an influx of new residents, mainly slaves who brought rich African traditions with them. Remnants of this can still be seen in much of today\u2019s music, dance and food. By the 19th century, coffee had taken the place of sugar as Brazil\u2019s most valuable crop. The increase in coffee production brought a new wave of migrants to Brazil, mainly from Europe, and Brazil\u2019s economy continued to flourish until the military coup of 1889., 13503=Brazil\u2019s more recently history has also been characterised by wide spread immigration \u2013 especially during and after World War II - with large numbers of Jewish people choosing to flee persecution to live in Brazil, as well as significant numbers of people from the Middle East and other European countries. In 1989, Brazil held its first democratic election in almost 30 years after decades of military rule. More recently, a stable government has resulted in increased economic prosperity, although many of Brazil\u2019s residents are still impoverished, living well below the poverty line.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading To learn more or donate, go to: www.theintrepidfoundation.org Working to improve the lives of the families living in the favela in the Roupa Suja neighbourhood, through education.
