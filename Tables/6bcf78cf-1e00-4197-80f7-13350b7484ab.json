On NehruvianDOOM, the latter drops a few verses, including his blueprint for rap success on \"Great Things,\" but he stays mainly behind the boards\u2014hence the familiar mix of muddy boom-bap beats, chopped-up movie dialogue, and various cartoony flourishes. Nehru's endlessly unspooling flow is full of internal rhymes and canny wordplay that would make his mentor proud. Short and sweet, this snapshot of a rising star doubles as the first Doom-produced album since 2003's Take Me to Your Leader.
