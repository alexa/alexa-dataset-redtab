Meanwhile, PlayStation Vita dropped to just 6,000 units sold. \u00a0 At #2 was Fire Emblem: Awakening, which continues to sell well week after week. The only new release for the week was Sony\u2019s StarHawk (above), at the #4 slot with close to 13,000 copies sold. \u00a0 The week after Japan\u2019s Golden Week holiday ended led to a decline in software and hardware sales across the board, owing to a lack of new releases and the working/studying population getting back into the daily grind. As a result, the highest selling game for the week was Mario Party 9 once again with just 37,000 copies sold during the week. \u00a0 PlayStation Vita sales: 6,340 | Total sales: 697,099 Nintendo 3DS sales: 46,425 | Total sales: 5,955,834 Top-seller:\u00a0Mario Party 9 \u2013 37,353 Period: The week of May 7th \u2013 May 13th (2012) By Ishaan .
