Presence finds Loeb smack in the middle of his comfort zone. \"Llevame\" adds some Latin percussion and murmured female vocals, \"The Western Sky\" incorporates a vaguely new age synth wash, and \"The Music Outside\" flirts a bit with quiet storm R&B, but at heart, this is utterly straightforward smooth jazz with Loeb's laid-back, tasty soloing front and center. Even the pair of pop covers, Steely Dan's \"Rikki Don't Lose That Number\" and James Taylor's \"Shed a Little Light,\" are transformed into showcases for Loeb's inimitable style. Unapologetically mellow and buffed to a high-sheen gloss, Presence is smooth jazz for folks who think they just don't make smooth jazz records like this anymore.
