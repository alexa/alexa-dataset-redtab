Cole had spent some time bringing the whole Drake, Wale, and Big Sean style to a more street level. It\u2019s worth mentioning because Cole World: The Sideline Story has little of that debut desire to cross over, and while the multi-talented Cole is a skilled, interesting beat-maker in his own right, a superstar production would have certainly made this album more approachable. Instead, No I.D. \u2014 the biggest behind-the-boards name here \u2014 turns in a sluggy, druggy construction for \u201cNever Told,\u201d Cole's deep, rich study of father/son confidence. Cole handles most of the rest on his own, turning in B+ stabs at dubstep (\u201cMr. Nice Watch\u201d with guest and label boss Jay-Z), indie-hop (\u201cCole World\u201d or \u201cflossin\u2019 with a laptop\u201d), and his own humbler version of the Roc-A-Fella sound (the great single \u201cLights Please\u201d). Add an \u201cIntro\u201d and then a part III \u2014 the first two parts to be found on earlier mixtapes \u2014 and you\u2019re practically telling the aboveground crowd they\u2019re stale from the start, but the tradeoff is a talent that has matured in the underground and is free of any forced outside influence. Cole\u2019s fantastic style shoots off bold punch lines one minute (\u201cI blow brains,", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
