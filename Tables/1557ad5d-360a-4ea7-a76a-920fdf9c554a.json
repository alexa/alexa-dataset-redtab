According to psychiatrists for something to be a delusion it must satisfy at least three criteria: certainty (held with absolute conviction) incorrigibility (not changeable by compelling counterargument or proof to the contrary) impossibility or falsity of content (implausible, bizarre or patently untrue) We know that humans do not die from complications of multiple traumas and suffoction and then get up and walk around, meet friends for lunch, etc., a couple of days later. To believe that the above is true would be a delusion. We know a human female cannot become pregnant without first having sperm enter her cervix while she is ovulating. To believe that a woman can conceive by having sex with 'God' is a delusion. When a big bunch of people gather together and believe these things in unison and claim that other people who do not believe these absurdities are basically screwed, it is called a group delusion.", ""]], "pageTitle": "BookTalk.org - View topic - Defining delusion.

Group think is a powerful, scary thing. I wonder how many really hold to their beliefs with absolute conviction and how many are really not swayed by compelling arguments. It seems that many religious people, at least many Christians, have doubts that they hide. So, is that really a delusion?
