Founder and remaining original member Frank Hart lightened his load by adding the talents of Kemper Crabb (mandolin), Ryan Birsinger (bass), and Joe Simmons (drums). The result is a more cohesive and professional-sounding recording than the previous all-Hart effort, Penguin Dust. The heavy Christian themes remain and are delivered in an unapologetic and sincere manner. The music itself is similar to King's X, but doesn't pack quite the same punch. The group's sound draws upon folk, progressive metal, and Christian rock influences and manages to produce a fairly original sound. A decent release by a band who is not afraid to mention the \"G\" word and, in fact, relishes in it. For those who may be curious from a musical standpoint only, there just isn't enough happening here to make it worth it. This is an all-or-nothing listening experience and is for distinct tastes only. Biography Genre: Rock Years Active: '90s, '00s Inspired by the Beatles/Queen-influenced progressive metal and spiritual focus of King's X (with whom he attended church while living in Springfield, MO), guitarist/vocalist/cellist Frank Hart founded", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
