That in itself was enough to get me to pick up this album. See, if you don\u2019t know, Think Differently Music is the brainchild of Bronze Nazarath, who coincidently is one of the 4 members of Wisemen. In 2005, Think Differently Music released one of the best hip hop albums in the last few years with Wu-Tang Meets Indie Culture. This album combined Wu-Tang Clan members with stars of the underground scene such as MF Doom, Del Tha Funky Homosapeien and Aesop Rock. This was a GREAT album, which led to my interest in this particular Wisemen CD. But something strange happened when I actually picked up this new album. Nowhere on it does it even mention Think Differently Music. \u201cOdd,\u201d me thought. That little fact really has nothing to do with this review. I just need to waste space. Is this space fully wasted?

Quite possibly the hands-down winner of the title \u201cGreatest Video of All-Time.\u201d Remember earlier when I said that the actor\u2019s foray into music never turns out well? I stand corrected. This is everything you\u2019d want a David Hasselhoff video to be, and more.
