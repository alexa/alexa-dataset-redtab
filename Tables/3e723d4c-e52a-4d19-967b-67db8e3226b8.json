As someone stated before, it is worth every penny. Big Boi knows how to maintain his image w/o selling out like the other artists that came out during his ear. Don't be such a drag and downloaded off some website. Support good music. A Breath Of Fresh Air \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by nathan141 What an incredible album! My guess is that Big Boi was trying to revitalize his career, and he's definitely made a good start. Left Foot was ok, but not terribly inventive. And it did little to separate him from OutKast. On Vicious Lies he has made something that is entirely his own. This album plays almost like something that would fall into the alternative genre. It's very cohesive, and very original. Great colabs, great beats, great lyrics, and catchy hooks. What else do you need?! no", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
