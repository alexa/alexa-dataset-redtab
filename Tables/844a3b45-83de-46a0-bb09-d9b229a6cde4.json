Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, and Liam Payne auditioned for England\u2019s popular talent show The X Factor as individual contestants, but Cowell suggested they form a five-piece vocal group. One Direction's debut album, Up All Night, opens with \u201cWhat Makes You Beautiful\u201d, a flirty pop hit with flawless harmonies and grappling hooks. The group moves closer to the dance floor with the pulsing \u201cTell Me a Lie\u201d, a Kelly Clarkson\u2013penned song that contrasts uplifting melodies with lovelorn lyrics of burning adolescent urgency. The singers prove their prowess as balladeers with \u201cGotta Be You\u201d, an elegantly produced number backed by lush string arrangements and soaring, congruent vocal magic coming together to make one voice. The lads are also adept at belting out arena-sized anthems, as evidenced by the epic \u201cOne Thing\u201d \u201cStole My Heart\u201d closes with vintage house production.
