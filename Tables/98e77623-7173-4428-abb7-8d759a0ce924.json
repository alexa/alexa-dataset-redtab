For the soundtrack, PB Wolf enlisted beat maestro Madlib to offer a number of previously unreleased tracks. The simply titled backing tracks (\u201cCue 1, 2, 3\u201d etc.) are fascinating in their own right, allowing listeners to witness the kind of chewy retro-soul-inspired hip-hop collaborations Madlib has been associated with over the years in chrysalis form. Elsewhere, the soundtrack corrals tracks by some of Stones Throw\u2019s brightest for rare and previously unreleased tracks, including a live cut from Dam-Funk (\u201cDon\u2019t Go Swag\u201d), a track by the sorely missed J Dilla (\u201cLightworks\u201d), songs by some of Stones Throw\u2019s lesser-known yet still-excellent artists like Vex Ruffin and James Pants, and some undisputed classics (Madvillain\u2019s timeless \u201cAll Caps\u201d). This soundtrack gives just as clear of a message as the film it accompanies\u2014Stones Throw kicks ass and always has. 05/26/2014 Amoeba Review CD Also available in: SHIPS FREE in U.S. $19.98 BUY", "textAfterTable": "Disc 2 Titles Artist Length 1.
