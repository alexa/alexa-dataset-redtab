I'm using a custom config file like this. However, when I post to the application, the post isn't appearing in the client side of the application. Since it's using websockets to communicate between client and server, i'm wondering if I have a problem with the port numbers. You can see in my config that the server is listening on 80, but the proxy_pass is set to localhost:3000. Should these numbers be the same? if so can I set Nginx to listen on 3000?
