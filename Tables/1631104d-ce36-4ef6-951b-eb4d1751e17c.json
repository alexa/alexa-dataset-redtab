Ratings: 1.50 Million Viewers Episode Notes Read the full recap Recap The episode begins with Zoe in her bed, apparently trying to eat her depression away. She isn\u2019t taking any calls from anyone and isn\u2019t even seeing her patients. She comes to Lavon\u2019s kitchen a while later. The situation gets really awkward when she sees Wade there, so Wade leaves for work in a hurry. Lemon and Magnolia still want Shelby out of Brick\u2019s life, which is why Lemon is happy that Shelby and Brick have returned early from their vacation. Lemon asks Magnolia to be patient and says they don\u2019t have to do a thing because Shelby will ruin their relationship by herself...

Shelby I am so sorry, I apologize for my sister's behaviour. Shelby: Oh well, we all wake up on the wrong side of the bed sometimes. George: Zoe, I know you are going through a rough time right now. If there is anything I can do, like punch Wade, or Tansy can punch Wade again, or...have anyone at all punch Wade. I've realized now that all my ideas involve punching Wade, but I can work on others. Zoe: Thank you George, that is very sweet. Jonah: Hey, heard you got dumped! Want to know what helps you get over those break-up blues? Mind blowing sex with a really hot doctor. Zoe: Man, if only I knew one I would give it a shot. Why are you here? Jonah: Just finished two gruelling weeks of applying", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
