The topics \u2014 teasing, aching, longing \u2014 aren't unfamiliar, yet they're often dealt with in a clever manner. Take \"Chewing Gum,\" in which a dumped boy gets sort of objectified and verbally slain at the same time (\"You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum\"), or \"The Greatest Hit,\" containing the most foolproof come-on you could ever give a record geek (\"C'mon, baby, you're my greatest hit\"). As cunning as it is, Anniemal is also deeply affecting. \"Heartbeat\" is the least resistible of all, glowing with anticipatory pulses, tremulous sighs, and quivering electric piano vamps., 129685=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
