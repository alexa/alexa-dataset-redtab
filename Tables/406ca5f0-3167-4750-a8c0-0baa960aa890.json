In my mind, I pictured a pool of liquid metal (a la Terminator 2) running uphill and morphing up into the Electro Specter, electricity arcing from it as it solidified. I also envisionned vein-like tunnels of the liquid rushing up, not unlike lava tubes. I feel that I'd captured all of that pretty successfully. Electro Specter emerging from a pile of liquid metal. The Electro Specter is another enemy that I'd not had a lot of interest in drawing for a good while.
