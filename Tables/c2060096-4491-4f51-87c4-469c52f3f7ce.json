The \"Pyramid Age\" lasted from about the 3rd Dynasty reign of Djoser (2630 BC) until the Reign of Ahmose I, which ended in about 1514 BC.

During the Pyramid Age, the mortuary temple was located right next to the pyramid itself, though after the Pyramid Age, the mortuary temple was separated from the tomb so that the tomb's location would be less obvious to grave robbers.
