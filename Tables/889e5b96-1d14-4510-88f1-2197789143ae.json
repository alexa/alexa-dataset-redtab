Not only was the album named among the year's best in many top heavy metal publications, but Black's increasing approachability helped put his vision into better context for would-be fans, and then of course the music vindicated everything because its essentially classicist approach didn't equate with dull revisionism or lack of sonic variety. Ready for the roll call? Here we go: opening number \"So Much for Sleep\" charges across the blasted plains on galloping Iron Maiden riffs embellished by serpentine lead guitars \u00e0 la Isen Torr (courtesy of Black's six-string pal Matt Johnsen); \"You Know Me\" violently pounds its stakes into the ground with the inexorable force and consistency of a steam hammer; \"The Devil\" threatens to speed off into thrash metal territory before geeking out on a jumble of riffs, Slough Feg style; \"Swing Hard\" and \"Cataract\" behave like Siamese sisters representing Dawnbringer's more gentle and melodious qualities, exposing Black's limited vocal prowess somewhat, but arguably overcoming them with his guests' elegiac electric and acoustic guitar work; \"Like an Earthquake\" offsets seismic punctuations with driving down-strums and surprisingly singable lyrics;", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
