However, between the two discs, there is a single LP's worth of prime neo-new wave synth funk, much of it attractively twisted and dipped in sleaze. J*Davey are a duo: Brook, the male half, does the production, seemingly inspired by the rhythmic complexities of both late-'70s dancefloor-oriented fusion and left-field hip-hop as much as synth-reliant new wave; Jack, the female half and the vocalist, is closer in sound to early Stacey Q than anyone else, if mostly a perverted droid of some unique kind. The collaborator list is extensive, including Georgia Anne Muldrow, ?uestlove, Phonte, and Kardinal Offishall, but J*Davey work best when they are on their own, or when assisted only by the odd instrumentalist \u2014 as they are on most of The Beauty in Distortion.
