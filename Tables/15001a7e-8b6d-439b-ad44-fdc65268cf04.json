Top Albums and Songs by Bluesmasters Rock fans really won't find much solace here, relative to the fact that the soulful vocals from longtime rockers Mickey Thomas and standout drummer Ansley Dunbar are tame in this collection of primarily three-chord progressions. Obviously, it's not rocket science to figure from the onset that this IS a blues album! Despite some solid moments, one can't help but wonder if these guys are just paying the rent with this gig, based on its scattered mediocrity. Waiting for Thomas' trademark high-octave vibrato vocals and inspired energetic drumming from Dunbar to kick in seems comparable to reversing the aging process; however, partiers and hardcore blues hounds should like this material, in contrast to desperate rock lovers simply searching for remnants! by C.P.O., Ret.", "textAfterTable": "Listeners Also Bought The Bluesmasters Live!
