Unfortunately, Paula's dad is too awesome to be able to come along...but there is a brief mention of Jeff! Are you excited? I'm excited.", "Darrow1 - #11 Everdred, who is definitely not a crook, casually passes off a wad of cash to Ness and Paula, who realize they can't actually spend any of it. Too bad they never learned how to do the Egg/Chicken trick. They would be set for life.", "Darrow1 - #12 Oh boy! It's a date to the Chaos Theater. Thanks to the ongoing contract battle between the Runaway Five and ol Poochyfud, backstage passes are currently going for $0.
