I've been offline for 2 days, with good reason though - I've finally moved out and am now officially homeless! Thursday was moving day, where we put most of our worldly possessions in storage. (And the moved was supposed to only take about 3 hours, and ended up taking all day). Today we drove for 8+ hours and are now somewhere in France. I couldn't get online Thursday (well actually I could have but just dropped down dead as soon as we got to the hotel) and well, here I am online finally at 1:30 AM on Sat. So, any pending questions and stuff...I'll try to get to tomorrow. Thanks for your patience!, 42333=My bento blog: http://justbento.com/blog/1305 My art blog: http://jizaacaso.deviantart.com}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 03:33:09 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "New forum activity since your last visit More information about formatting options Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.
