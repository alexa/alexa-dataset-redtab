I don\u2019t know how it happened, but I\u2019d never heard Clark Terry\u2019s big band ballad album Clark After Dark until a couple of weeks ago on a radio station that will go nameless (WKCR) and it just bowled me over. We\u2019re not talking Miles and Gil here: the charts sound like Nelson Riddle from 1959, and the record, Clark\u2019s personal favorite, was made in \u201977 and came out the year after. I was a full-time jazz crrritic at the time and got everything, but I didn\u2019t get that one, and then somehow missed it for another few decades. I love Clark Terry, and we all expect him to be warm and wonderful, but the beauty of his playing on this record is profound, and a real heart-melter. Not enough for you? How about Duke Ellington\u2019s Blues in Orbit, also featuring Terry, and Terry with Monk, plus Terry with Mingus, four cuts from the band with Bob Brookmeyer and we take it out with Mumbles? The sweetest cat in the world and sounds like it, turned 93 in December, and still the only man on earth who can simultaneously play two brass instruments using only the strength of his lapels. You have to tune in for that.
