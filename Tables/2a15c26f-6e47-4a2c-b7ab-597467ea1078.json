I was amazed that I had not heard of hhim before now. One listen to his video had me at his web page looking for more info on him and then downloading both Abrupt Changes and Procrastination. Guitar talent this good usually doesn't stay under cover long, but with him being Peruvian I'm not surprised it took a little while for me to get aquainted with his work. Outstanding! Solid performances. Has some good videos on his site.If you like fast guitars such as Randy Rhoades, John Petrucci, Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani, you can't go wrong with Charlie Parra del Riego!
