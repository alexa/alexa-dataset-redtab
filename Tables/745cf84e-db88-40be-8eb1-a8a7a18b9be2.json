He is an associate professor of music at Georgia State University in Atlanta, GA. Atlanta is also the home of his studio and his music label, Aucourant Records. Through that label, Thompson releases CDs in at least six genres. He records electronic and experimental pop, modern classical, new age, avant-garde and his two major genres \u2014 experimental computerized and ambient music. In a career over 20 years long, he has released over 25 CDs and CDRs. Thompson earned a Ph.D. in music composition, computer applications to music synthesis, digital recording, and sound processing from the University of California at San Diego in 1990. In 1991, he was named a Fulbright Research Scholar to Denmark and continued his composing and studying at the Danish Institute of Electroacoustic Music. That intellect and education have afforded Thompson the vehicles and opportunities to compose, create, and record his highly emotional and spiritual music from an intellectual approach. Like most modern ambient minimalism, the music is full of meaning. Unlike much modern minimalism, Thompson's meanings hit listeners from many different levels from many different angles. His experimental style has garnered many awards and much of his work has been five to ten years ahead of its time. Such foresight and vision often strike fear in promoters and listeners.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59323=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
