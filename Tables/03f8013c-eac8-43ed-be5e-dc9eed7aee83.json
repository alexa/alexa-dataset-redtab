For copyright reasons, and despite being the theme song to the program, the most famous song, \"Fame,\" originally sung by Irene Cara but sung on the TV show by Erica Gimpel, the new actress playing Coco Hernandez on the series, was not allowed to be on the Kids from Fame album, but having a weekly audience of millions, they set out to create their own classics and during 1982 came up with two very different songs as singles, \"Hi Fidelity,\" the uptempo, singalong, dance-along happy song with Valerie Lansburg as Doris Schwartz on lead vocals, bouncing along and grinning from ear to ear, and \"Starmarker,\" the ballad that the kids all took a line each to sing to the drama teacher Mr. Crandall on his retirement. The songs on the album ranged between the two extremes, of ensemble dance numbers (\"I Can Do Anything Better Than You Can,\" \"Life Is a Celebration,\" and \"Desdemona\") to solo ballads (\"I Still Believe in Me,\" \"It's Gonna Be a Long Night\" and \"Be My Music\").
