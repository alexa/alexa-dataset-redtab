It\u2019s also hard to imagine just how critically dismissed they were based on their safe-for-mom coifs, suits, and songs, such as \u201cI\u2019m Henry the VIII I Am\u201d and an absolute bubblegum version of Sam Cooke\u2019s \u201c(What A) Wonderful World.\u201d It\u2019s too bad, because the gems were many, and singer Peter Noone was blessed a soothing radio tenor that not only drove teen girls crazy but also let the songs age really well. And the tunes are more varied than many might think. The waltz-timed \u201cEast West,\u201d \u201cSunshine Girl,\u201d and \u201cMy Sentimental Friend,\u201d for example, all have a decidedly California sunshine-pop sound, while others touch on the baroque, such as the irresistible and string-backed \u201cNo Milk Today\u201d and \u201cHere Comes the Star.\u201d Even the ubiquitous hits (\u201cThere\u2019s a Kind of Hush,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t You Hear My Heartbeat,\u201d and Goffin-King's great \u201cI\u2019m Into Something Good\u201d) take on certain relevance in this historic context, where 23 of the 26 songs made the Top 40 in either the U.S. or the U.K. Customer Reviews The real deal \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
