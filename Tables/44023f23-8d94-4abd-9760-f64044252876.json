Try to catch them at a club in Detroit -- they are awesome performers. One of the best organ trios today... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by blugroov True to their reputation, these cats are fantastic performers. I had a chance to catch them twice at the '03 and '05 Detroit/Montreaux Jazz Fest. Both times were mind blowing, and made me want to explode in a jazz fury. Chris Codish is amazing, but his bassist deserves oodles of credit for his contribution to a complex and highly-skilled laid-down foundation to The Brothers' music. I believe him to be one of the finest and most talented bassists today. I also disagree with iTunes's delegation of \"Pop\" to this album, because it has much more blues and funk elements to it than anything else. Clamp It Down is far superior to it's follow-up \"So Glad You Came\", if you are", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
