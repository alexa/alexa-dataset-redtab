Ablation test are meant to help better understand the relevance of the knowledge resources used by RTE systems, and evaluate the contribution of each of them to the systems' performances. In fact, comparing the results achieved in the ablation tests to those obtained by the systems as a whole allows assessing the contribution given by each single resource. Ablation Tests RTE7 - Call for Resources RTE6 - Call for Resources In order to help the research, all the participants are invited to contribute, sharing their own resources with the RTE community. Making the resources available to be used by other systems has several advantages. On the one hand, it helps improve the TE technology; on the other hand, it offers an opportunity to further test and evaluate the resource.
