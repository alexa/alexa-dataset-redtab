Added default triggers for Blood Swarm and Shadow Infusion x5. Efflorescense is now detected and displayed as a pet heal. Created new events for outgoing pet heals, pet heal crits, pet periodic heals (HoTs), and pet periodic heal (HoT) crits. Added Skill ID as an available condition for player and pet cooldown triggers. Added Pet Cooldown Complete to the available trigger events. Changed Skill Cooldown Complete trigger event to Player Cooldown Complete (only detects player cooldowns). Added an option to customize the color of the skill name in cooldown events. Created new event for customizable pet cooldown notifications. Implemented a work around for Blizzard's cooldown bug with dismissed pets. Pet cooldowns should no longer be shown before they are actually finished. Made several updates to the cooldown tracking system: 5.5.89 Updated Korean translations from chkid. Added the new pet heal events to the options interface so they may be customized and disabled as intended. 5.5.91 Updated TOC for Patch 4.1. Updated German translations from mojosdojo. Updated Russian translations from StingerSoft. Modified combat event log parsers to work with the changes in Patch 4.1 (committed by mojosdojo, reported by several others).", "textAfterTable": "Archived Files (36) File Name Version Size Author Date \u00a0 MikScrollingBattleText 5.7.137 593kB Mikord 10-16-14 04:06 PM \u00a0 MikScrollingBattleText 5.7.136 592kB Mikord 10-16-14 02:13 PM \u00a0 MikScrollingBattleText 5.7.135 592kB Mikord 10-15-14 11:51 PM \u00a0 MikScrollingBattleText 5.7.134 591kB Mikord 10-15-14 11:25 AM \u00a0 MikScrollingBattleText 5.7.132 591kB Mikord", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
