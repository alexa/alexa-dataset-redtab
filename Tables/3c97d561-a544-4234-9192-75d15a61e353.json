A: The most accessible versions of Lovecraft\u2019s tales are paperback editions by Ballantine/Del Rey. They are very inexpensive and are available in most large bookstores. The definitive versions of H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s stories (as well as Mythos fiction by other authors) are available in hardback from Arkham House Publishers, Inc. They include: Q: What are the \u201cposthumous collaborations\u201d? A: After Lovecraft\u2019s death, August Derleth took fragments of Lovecraft\u2019s writings (from his Commonplace Book, for example), and incorporated them into stories entirely of Derleth\u2019s own design. According to S.T. Joshi\u2019s Bibliography, Derleth\u2019s The Lurker at the Threshold is 50,000 words long, and only incorporates 1,200 words by Lovecraft\u00a0\u2013 that\u2019s about 2.4%. None of these \u201cposthumous collaborations\u201d should be considered to have been authored by Lovecraft. In spite of this, these stories have been published as being authored by Lovecraft and Derleth, or, worse yet, solely by Lovecraft. Both the Carroll & Graf paperbacks, The Lurker at the Threshold and The Watchers Out of Time include only Lovecraft\u2019s name on their covers, although they are almost wholly Derleth\u2019s work. Q: What other authors wrote stories set in Lovecraft\u2019s Cthulhu Mythos? A: An amazing number of writers set their stories in Lovecraft\u2019s world. The best known amongst these are Robert Bloch, Ramsey Campbell, Lin Carter, August Derleth, Robert E. Howard, Stephen King, Frank Belknap Long, Brian Lumley, and Clark Ashton Smith.

At that point, the page proofs for volume III were lost, and that volume was not reprinted until popular demand brought it back in 1997. Arkham House has yet to announce plans to reprint any of the Selected Letters volumes. Q: Where can I find a biography of Lovecraft? A: There are actually a few noteworthy biographies of Lovecraft: H.P. Lovecraft: A Life by S.T. Joshi\u00a0\u2013 Published in 1996 by Necronomicon Press, this is certainly the best biography of Lovecraft available. Joshi examines all aspects of Lovecraft\u2019s life and works without whitewashing them at all. A must-read for all fans of Lovecraft.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
