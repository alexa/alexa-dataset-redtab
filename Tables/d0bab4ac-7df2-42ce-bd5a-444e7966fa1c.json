Billy Gil, Hollywood 06/26/2012 The Tarnished Gold\u00a0is everything you'd reasonably hope for from the Sparks after ten years of inactivity. Their psychedelic canyon country rock is as alive as ever and the Byrdsian melodies continue to float by. This album is mature, sweet, and breezy with the perfect amount of honey. There aren't as many uptempo jams as on their previous albums, not that there were many to begin with and even then they were mellow tunes, but that's okay. This album is more concerned with being effortlessly beautiful than attention grabbing. I mean that in the best way.\u00a0The Tarnished Gold\u00a0is a pretty stellar album that doesn't need to impress you but does so anyway.
