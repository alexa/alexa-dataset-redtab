Whether shitkicking with cow-punk jams like \u201cNorth Cackalacky Girl\u201d or delivering touching, string-laden odes to yearning like \u201cNever Coming Home,\u201d Cartwright\u2019s throaty tenor paints vivid images of life lessons that come across as tender but without a trace of sentimentality. Though Shattered\u2019s country overtones help to enunciate the heartache prevalent in these songs, especially in the lovely \u201cIf You Gotta Leave\u201d and stirring \u201cOnce More,\u201d Cartwright and co. also do well by tapping into the Nuggets reserve, tearing through classic garage-rock tropes on the rollicking \u201cYou Did Wrong\u201d and Stonesy \u201cMy My.\u201d And like the Stones before them, Reigning Sound know how to make these disparate rock \u2018n\u2019 roll strains hang together beautifully, given the album\u2019s fuss-free production and unhurried grace. By the time they get to the soulful \u201cStarting New,\u201d it\u2019s clear that Cartwright has earned the ability to make classic rock that doesn\u2019t just sound that way, but feels essential as well. 07/14/2014 Amoeba Review Download Vinyl LP, Also available in: SHIPS FREE in U.S. $14.98 BUY", "textAfterTable": "BUY $14.98 SHIPS FREE in U.S. Also available in: LP , Download User Reviews Overall Rating 0 Submissions RATE & REVIEW Who We Are Amoeblog Buy Sell Trade News & Contests Gift Certificates Contact Us Support & FAQ Sign-up for email news, sales alerts & more:", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
