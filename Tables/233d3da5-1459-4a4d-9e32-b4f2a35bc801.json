My goal is to learn the technique of producing a 3-shot HDR composite image. Of course, first I need to come up with the images. Does the D-90 have the capability to: Automatically, i.e. \"burst\" mode (single shutter depression) take 3 shots a) 2 stops apart (meter - under - over) b) with each of them taken 2-3 seconds from each other? Can it be set-up so that with one depression you obtain what you need for an HDR image? I have unstable hands so if I press the shutter 3x instead of once its more likely to produce unintended movement. I can do the bracketing part, however I need to tie in the single click factor into the equation. Please guide me in this process.

With other bodies if the Release mode is set to Continuous High or low when bracketing is On the shutter will release 1 set of bracketed images. >a) 2 stops apart (meter - under - over) Yes! In Bracketing mode, Bracketing progress 3F, Bracketing increment 2.0 Custom Setting e6", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
