In 1885, the region came under British influence and became known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate, mainly as a tactic to avoid being overrun by the Boers who were campaigning in the region. This status continued for decades, until increasing nationalism in the 1950s led to an internal push for independence.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading 10.
