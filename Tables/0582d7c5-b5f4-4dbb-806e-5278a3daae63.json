I love how almost all the songs are heavier and incorporate that awesome techno sound. Also I'm excited that there are 12 tracks instead of the usual 10 and they are almost all at least four minutes long. Great job I See Stars. Review The Album Guys \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by YeahKid1+2=3 All these reviews are before the album actualy came out. After listening to New Demons a couple times, I'm not a big fan of them using the synthesizers in an effort to beef up their breakdowns into a dubstep-like sound. They over-used them and because of that, a lot of the songs sound same. Definitely preferred Digital Renegade.
