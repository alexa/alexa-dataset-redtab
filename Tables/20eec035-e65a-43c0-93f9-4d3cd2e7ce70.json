To be truthful, while the band did write and perform more structurally formal material on 2007's City of Echoes, they retained their trademark post-metal aesthetic \u2014 percussive repetition, overtone basslines, and nuanced guitar riffing. On What We All Come to Need, they have taken it not a step further, but a step more inside that aesthetic. The concentration here is on songwriting rather than riffing. There is a decidedly more melodic bent here than on any of the band's previous releases, and yet, given the album's production \u2014 it was produced, engineered, and mixed by Chris Common \u2014 it's also heavier, if that's possible. What We All Come to Need is decidedly more lyrical, though it's also more powerful post-metal. The deliberate muddiness and \"sonic thud\" on their former recordings is gone here, making this the most sonically and compositionally accessible album they've cut thus far. The band enlisted help: bassist Ben Verellen from Helms Alee adds a guest bass part on the album opener \"Glimmer.\" The track opens with some controlled, ambient feedback, an lower-octave melody line asserts itself in earnest on a single guitar before the crunch of the power riff follows.
