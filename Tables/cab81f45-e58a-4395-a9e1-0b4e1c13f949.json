After aging out of drum corps, I still wanted to stay as involved in the marching activity as much as possible. I was instructing numerous marching bands in my area at the time, and wanted to get more involved with writing marching band music., 32372=After my first year of high school marching band, I joined the Jersey Surf Drum and Bugle Corps, based in Mt. Holly, NJ, and spent 6 years there (\u201999-\u201904), 4 in the hornline as soprano section leader and soloist, and 2 years as drum major. After that, I finished my DCI performing career with 2 years in the Concord Blue Devils on upper lead trumpet in 2005 and 2006. \u201cThe Godfather, Part Blue\u201d was my age out show, with finals in Madison, WI, where I started in 1999 with my first finals in the Jersey Surf.

While it wasn\u2019t the most visually appealing, I was proud to have built it myself and have something concrete to get started. Before launching the website, I wrote my first three original shows so I could have some material available. In the spring of 2007, Standing \u2018O\u2019 Marching officially hit the web, and that year I started by arranging for two local New Jersey Bands., 77953=Billy Strayhorn (1915-1967), an American composer, pianist, and arranger, composed \u201cTake the \u2018A\u2019 Train\u201d in 1939.

The note started, \u201cTake the \u2018A\u2019 train\u2026\u201d and Strayhorn used it as the title for his composition which was to become the theme song of Duke Ellington and his orchestra, one of their biggest hits, and one of the masterpieces of jazz repertoire., 65426=Members of the Weezic and MakeMusic teams, seen in MakeMusic\u2019s Boulder offices in June, 2015., 38818=At The Midwest Clinic in Chicago, 2012, I was exhibiting across from the MakeMusic booth, so I had the good fortune of watching the SmartMusic demo about 20 times a day throughout the convention. The guys giving the demo were outstanding and really showcased the program practically. By the end of the week, I was hooked and ready to dive in with my students. I had a flash drive from the MakeMusic booth loaded with information about SmartMusic, as well as product information to pass on to my school administration., 93777=Scott Rush is the Director of Fine and Performing Arts for Dorchester School District Two in South Carolina.
