That same year, the group recorded It's About Time with producer Greg Shaw, but splintered later in the year. Vocalist/guitarist Paula Pierce recruited three new players, while the old band toured for a short time, using the Pandoras' name as well. Pierce and her new lineup released Stop Pretending in 1986 on Rhino, and then moved up to the majors with an Elektra deal.... Full bio Top Albums and Songs by The Pandoras 1.
