Under the moniker Love & The Outcome, this Christian husband-and-wife duo fill their songs with a sense of spiritual hope and joy. Lead singer King\u2019s upbeat style of modern pop fuses with bassist Rademaker\u2019s rock inclinations to produce a bright, hook-laden sound. Love & The Outcome are adept at wrapping breezy melodies around solid Scripture-based lyrics without preachiness. The first single, \u201cHe Is with Us,\u201d embodies the duo\u2019s appeal with its honeyed vocals, clap-along beat, and anthemic chorus. \u201cWhen We Love,\u201d \u201cBring Us Back,\" and \u201cKing of My Heart\u201d are likewise engaging, delivering positive content matched with shimmering melodies and gliding grooves. \u201cCity of God\u201d slows down the tempo for an inspirational message that reaches across cultural boundaries. Getting more personal, King reflects on family tragedies and ultimate redemption in \u201cThe Story You\u2019re Building in Me,\u201d a track with a folk-pop flavor.
