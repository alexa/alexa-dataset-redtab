I'm really thrilled to have in my hands and read through several times in the past couple of days a cookbook that will help me in lots of ways now when I need it most, and besides has given hours of pleasure already. :-} I also decided to say no more of it on the forum once I learned of the Amazon arrangement, but changed my mind when I saw your reply and thought others might care to hear my reasoning on the subject., 14599=The Book Depository's price is \u00a310.49 (12.62 Euro, US$16.45), delivery in November, with FREE shipping worldwide (and their parcels get to me right on the other side of the world in a week). Amazon has it for US$13.46 plus shipping., 31125=I believe that not being able to ship within Japan is just because the company is not set up for it - but I'm not certain. I guess we could ask Thomas of Bento&co about that ^_^ (I met him in Kyoto back in March, he's a great guy who has totally embraced life in Japan. His command of Japanese is amazing for someone who's only been there for a few years!) Anyway, I do agree that perhaps ordering the book by itself from them is not the cheapest, but rather combining it with another order. Or for the super-impatient who Must Have It Now!, 27789=Edit: No, that doesn't explain it. The rrp in England works out to only 1900 yen, and in the US to 1724 yen. So they're cheaper even before the discounting., 23265=For what it's worth, what Bento & co is charging is what they are allowed to charge as a company operating from Japan - in Japan, a retailer is not allowed to discount a new book (I think France, Germany, Switzerland and some other countries have the same law). So they are charging the fixed retail price of 2100 yen. Personally I think that if you're going to ordering something else from B&co anyway, it's not a bad deal to get the book too (cough) ^_^; Casabento.com should also have it in stock shortly I hear.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:22:20 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "New forum activity since your last visit More information about formatting options Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.
