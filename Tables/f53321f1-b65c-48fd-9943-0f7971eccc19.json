It was a heaping dose of TMZ-fueled gossip that feeds the part of her second album, Redemption, that isn't devoted to songs of love, sex, and nightclubs, songs that suggest Brooke Hogan is a pretty simple, sweet girl who only wants love and understanding. In another era, she'd be Sandra Dee singing about holding hands, but in 2009, she's a Britney wannabe singing about \"BeDDable\" boyfriends and rough sex, laying bare the explicit thoughts BritBrit only hints at. Britney's Blackout is a clear sonic template for Redemption, with Brooke happily embracing whatever role is handed her, only taking control on her vitriolic attack on her mother, delivered completely with an actual argument pasted over the bridge, and the ominous self-empowerment of the title track.
