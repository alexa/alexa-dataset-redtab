His voice is uncannily similar to his former stepfather's, Merle Haggard. And of course his talented singer/songwriter mother is Leona Williams who was married to Haggard from 1978 - 1984. I'm thinking maybe Merle's style rubbed off just a bit on Ron Williams. His voice is smooth and pleasing, and the tunes include classics like (They Call Me A ) Playboy. He sings a duet with his mom on Somewhere Between, and he covers an old Conway Twitty tune with (A) Bridge That Just Won't Burn. He just generally hits a \"Texas Style\" home run in the country music world with this album!, 124056=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
