On this collection, Paxton foregoes topical satire for the timeless beauty of some of his finest ballads, with the primary subject matter being romantic love and the complexities thereof. There are newly recorded classics from the Paxton catalog, like \"I Give You the Morning,\" \"Outward Bound,\" \"Dance in the Shadows,\" and the oft-recorded \"The Last Thing on My Mind.\" There are also new compositions, including the title track. Because the emphasis here is on his serious, thoughtful side, Even a Gray Day is one of Tom Paxton's most enduring, endlessly enjoyable recordings. Biography Born: 31 October 1937 in Chicago, IL Genre: Singer/Songwriter Years Active: '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s, '00s, '10s Tom Paxton proved to be one of the most durable of the singer/songwriters to emerge from the Greenwich Village folk revival scene of the early '60s. In some ways, he had more in common with the late-'50s generation of folksingers such as Dave Van Ronk (who was 16 months his senior) and even older performers", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
