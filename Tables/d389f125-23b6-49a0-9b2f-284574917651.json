The old-school soul cover of Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 \u201cWelcome to the Jungle\u201d goes beyond novelty; James finds the song\u2019s heart and wrings out true sentiment. Little Big Town\u2019s \u201cBoondocks\u201d becomes a dirty blues. Little Milton\u2019s \u201cLet Me Down Easy\u201d proves that even with her voice not what it once was, James can do more with phrasing a lyric than other singers can do with a torrent of notes. Bob Montgomery\u2019s \u201cMisty Blue\u201d uses a classic electric guitar to organ formation, leaving enough room for James to play. Her spirit is still strong on the fiery blues of Johnny \u201cGuitar\u201d Watson\u2019s \u201cToo Tired.\u201d Classic tracks like Otis Redding\u2019s \u201cCigarettes & Coffee\u201d and \u201cChampagne & Wine\u201d have a touching, forlorn feel. They take on added poignancy sung by James, one of the few survivors of that bygone era. We won\u2019t see the likes of her again.\u00a0 Customer Reviews Not a bad farewell \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by JMGierman I love Etta James with all my", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
