As he lived in San Francisco, he also influenced the Latin Rock movement of the late 1960s and early 70s. This cover of a Gillespie-Pozo tune was the hit title track from one of his most memorable albums.", "Conguero Poncho Sanchez continues the tradition of the West Coast Latin Jazz scene with this live performance from 1999, covering Herbie Hancock's classic \"Watermelon Man\", a hit in 1963 for conguero Mongo Santamar\u00eda.", "Brazilian music has also influenced Jazz, especially 60s Bossa Nova. This composition, one of the most ubiquitous songs in (and out) of Jazz, was a collaboration by American saxophonist Stan Getz and two Brazilian masters: composer Antonio Carlos Jobim and guitarist Jo\u00e3o Gilberto."]], "pageTitle": "Latin Music USA | PBS", "title": "", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/latinmusicusa/en/exp/latinjazz/listen.html", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 2, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988458.74/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00275-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 638404030, "recordOffset": 638395828, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{10240=\u00a9 2009 WGBH Educational Foundation.
