Fortunately, the people behind this release have done a super job. Although it includes none of the band's lengthy jams which made up the bulk parts of Focus III, Moving Waves, and Hamburger Concerto, Hocus Pocus is one of the best releases to highlight what Focus were all about. Featuring all of the hits and semi-hits the band were ever known for (\"Sylvia,\" \"Hocus Pocus,\" \"House of the King\"), as well as the fans favorites (\"Focus [Instrumental]\", \"Harem Scarem,\" \"Anonymous\") this release highlights the musical ability and amazing songwriting talent that were part and parcel of Focus. There is, unfortunately, a little too much of the track listing hailing from the band's rather weak funk/rock album Mother Focus. There are also a few exclusions that could have added to the album's diversity, namely \"Moving Waves,\" \"Love Remembered,\" and \"Round Goes the Gossip.\" Although the band's seminal album, Focus III, perhaps provides a more accurate picture of their overall makeup, Hocus Pocus will unquestionably gratify the purchaser.
