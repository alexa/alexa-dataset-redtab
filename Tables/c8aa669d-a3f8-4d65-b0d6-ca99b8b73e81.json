Stunning \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Sterney I love this album. This guy is an amazing composer of beautiful tunes. Not one duff track. I found myself smiling as tunes took an unexpected turn, Clark is so unpredictable. I think he may be a musical genius. Well produced \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by TelevisionHard 5 stars for production, although I was hoping for something a little harder from Clark. It seems a lot of IDM artists are going in this direction. Still has that Clark vibe and eerie atmosphere. Biography", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
