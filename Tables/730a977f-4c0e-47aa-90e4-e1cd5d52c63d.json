Generally, January and February are the high season for travel in Tanzania as the hot, dry weather is generally considered to be the most pleasant.

Zanzibar was first controlled by the Portuguese, then by Arabian traders interested in easy access to the Indian Ocean that allowed trade with Asia and beyond. This was also a time when the human slave trade was a lucrative business. The island of Zanzibar became a pivotal place for this trade, with more than 100,000 slaves passing through during this period. Mainland Tanzania came under the influence of German, Belgian and British colonisers in the 1800s, who explored and mapped the interior of the country. German colonisers brought infrastructure, agriculture and Christianity to Tanzania, but faced resistance from many tribes who fought against being forced into labour and desperately wanted to keep their land and preserve their traditional way of life. During World War I, Germany lost the colony to the British, heralding a new era of colonial rule for the region. More recently, Tanzania adopted its constitution in 1977, held its first multi-party election in 1995 and had its first female presidential candidate in 2005.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading To learn more or donate, go to: www.theintrepidfoundation.org This project is committed to improving the education of Tanzanian children living in villages.
