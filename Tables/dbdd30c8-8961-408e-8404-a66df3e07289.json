Etta didn't start recording for Sony's Epic label until 1989, so this is only going to be Etta's newer, non-hit material [including a re-recording of \"At Last\"]. There is also an \"Essential\" CD on the Chess label and THAT'S the CD with Etta's 1960's hits. iTunes doesn't help by confusing the two CDs in their Album Review above.
