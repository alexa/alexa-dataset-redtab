Though still common, Lushai (or Lusei, or Lushei) is considered incorrect by the Mizo themselves.[3] Much poetic language is derived from Pawi, Paite, and Hmar, and most known ancient poems considered to be in the Mizo language are actually in Pawi.[3], 36367=Mizo language is related to the other languages of the Sino-Tibetan family.[7] The Kukish languages (which native Mizo speakers call Zohnahthl\u00e2k \u1e6dawngho/Mizo \u1e6dawngho) have a substantial amount of words in common,[8] and Hmar and Mizo language are especially similar; they are close to being mutually intelligible at the spoken level, and they are mostly mutually intelligible at the poetic level.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 00:48:44 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "The following table illustrates the similarity between Mizo \u1e6dawng and some other members of the Sino-Tibetan family.[9] The words given are cognates, whose origins could be traced back to the proto-language Proto-Sino-Tibetan (given in the first column of the table).
