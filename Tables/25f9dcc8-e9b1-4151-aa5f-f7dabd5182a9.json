I liked this album because it had some slower songs and a couple heavier ones too keeping people on both sides of the spectrum satisfied. I can't even pick a favorite song but a couple I really liked were \"Behind Those Eyes\", \"My World\", and \"Live for Today\". Also \"Right Where I Belong\" is an awesome opening song-- it rocks!!
