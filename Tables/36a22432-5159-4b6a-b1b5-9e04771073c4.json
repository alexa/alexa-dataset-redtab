Opening", "textAfterTable": "17 Items Editors\u2019 Notes Snatches of Christmas carols make their way into these Amos-penned tunes of the moody winter season. Joy is in the ear of the beholder and Amos vacillates between open joy (\u201cHarps of Gold\u201d) and sublime winter mystery (\u201cWhat Child, Nowell\u201d) where she entwines traditional Christmas melodies with her own sophisticated soundscapes. This lush, orchestrated collection, centered with Amos at the piano, creates a warm, crackling fire with its deep twists of drama. \u201cSnow Angel\u201d beats forth with a weaving string section that resembles endless ocean waves. \u201cHolly, Ivy and Rose\u201d lingers between the foreboding stillness of the frozen air and the season\u2019s festive joy. Midwinter Graces is not an album of seasonal cheer, but an album of seasonal mysticism that will appeal to Amos\u2019 fans, who have been sent on many an adventure with recent studio albums. The gentle twinkle of \u201cJeanette, Isabella,\u201d the nightclub swagger of \u201cPink and Glitter,\u201d the solemn austerity of \u201cEmmanuel\u201d and the sneak peek into future hope with \u201cOur New Year\u201d are among the most straightforward and touching works Amos has constructed.
