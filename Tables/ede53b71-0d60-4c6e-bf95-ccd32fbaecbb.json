However, this is the first one I\u2019ve listened to and I quite like it. My main complaint about Christian music is that the compositions are often trite and unimaginative with lyrics lazily pulled straight out of the book of Psalms. Saved has Dylan bringing his signature style, almost a swagger, to faith-based songs. Sure, it\u2019s not as good as his output in the 60s but that may be an unfair standard to hold it to. A deep cut for sure, and a pleasantly rewarding one. Saved \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by unknownlegend Truly a hidden treasure of Bob Dylan's music. Powerful songs and performance by a fervent Dylan.... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by arotolo", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
