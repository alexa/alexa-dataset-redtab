Their sultry 2013 debut, Woman, lit passions everywhere, with critics tagging Milosh\u2019s silky, androgynous voice as a Sade for the new millennium. But longtime fans of the musician have been reduced to quivering pools of surrender since his 2004 debut, You Make Me Feel. Jet Lag confidently filters all that\u2019s come before into a pure and flawless mix. Creating a murky, languorous atmosphere, Jet Lag moves into an R&B sea of desire and physical expression that stays just this side of the Sade line. It feels both celebratory and declarative. Knowing Milosh recently married, songs like \u201cDon\u2019t Call It\u201d and \u201cDo You Want What I Need\u201d exude a different kind of longing (his wife\u2019s belly provides some percussion on the latter). Here we are, the artist seems to proclaim; let\u2019s ride it when we can and work it when needed. Moments of unabashed flame-lighting, as on \u201cHold Me\u201d and \u201cJet Lag,\u201d are a sensual thrill, and two of many reasons this collection could do double duty as an aphrodisiac., 122379=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.

If you can get past that, you'll find his solo work to be electric and sensual in a way that is so much classier and professional than the top 40 stuff dominating the charts.
