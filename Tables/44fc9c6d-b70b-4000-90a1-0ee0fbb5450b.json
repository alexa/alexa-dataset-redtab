So even if the title is curious, the impulse behind the collection isn't and, given the scattered discography of the band, Greatest Hits is the perfect place for a neophyte to take the plunge.

Jad Fair's love-it-or-hate-it voice (and sometimes David Fair's more conventional approach) tackles everything from \"My Sordid Past\" to \"Salt and Pepper\" and back again, and his fluctuating crew keeps everything a ragged delight. For the hardcore, five otherwise unreleased tracks do surface. A cover of Jimmie Rodgers' \"T for Texas\" features Eugene Chadbourne as a duet partner, while the on-the-face-of-it surprising 1993 remake of Primal Scream's \"Movin' on Up\" becomes an enjoyable rave-up in the band's own garage-y way. \"King Kong\" makes for an amusing biography of said character, while \"Amazing Clock\" and \"Identical Twins\" are also enjoyable. David Fair's enjoyable and encouraging essay \"How to Play Guitar\" makes for a great final touch.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 08:59:57 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Open iTunes to preview, buy and download music.
