The pair discovered a creative compatibility that resulted in this rewarding project. Presented like one of the duo's concerts, the album jumps from classical pieces such as Schubert\u2019s \u201cNight and Dreams\u201d and traditional songs like \u201cWayfaring Stranger\u201d to jazz standards (Billie Holiday\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Explain\u201d) and four Merritt originals. Dinnerstein performs Bach\u2019s \u201cPrelude in B Minor\u201d before Merritt gives a vocal and acoustic guitar delivery of her own \u201cStill Not Home.\u201d The two shared arranging duties on four numbers and used established arrangements on others, including violinist Jenny Scheinman\u2019s for the sublime Patty Griffin\u2013penned title track. \u201cThe Cohen Variations\u201d was commissioned by Dinnerstein and is Daniel Felsenfield\u2019s solo piano interpretation of Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cSuzanne.\u201d Night closes perfectly with a quietly uplifting rendition of Johnny Nash\u2019s \u201cI Can See Clearly Now.\u201d Customer Reviews This is amazing \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Quartetronome This album is brave and vulnerable and exactly the kind of album I love to listen to. The Schubert and Dido's Lament are worth the price", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
