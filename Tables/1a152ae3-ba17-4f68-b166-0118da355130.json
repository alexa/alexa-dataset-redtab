Among his 60+ gigs last year you might have caught him at a club in\u00a0London, on a junk raft floating down the Mississippi, at Shambhala festival in British Columbia, at a tiny breakcore party in Osaka, or in front of forty thousand at the Boulevards festival in Casablanca. In any context it gets riotous- Filastine bangs out his music, jumping between a tangle of electronics, acoustic percussion, and an amplified shopping cart, firing off riddims and synchronized live video. In 2006 Filastine dropped his debut release, Burn It, to much critical acclaim. Vibrant and original, Burn It made inroads among music fans from the hiphop, world, electronic, and experimental scenes; it was snatched up and re-released by French label Jarring Effects, Japanese label Romz, and US anarcho-collective Crimethinc. Tracks from the album received airplay on the radio shows of Mary Anne Hobbes & John Peel, and in France peaked at #15 in national independent radio charts. Less visible are the spins on pirate stations across Latin America, or the more than fifty thousand downloads of his dj mix commissioned by Blentwell.com. Other releases include pirate mixtapes and a selection of sold-out vinyl. Look for his latest 12\" on Tigerbeat6's Shockout with partner Maga Bo in their duo project Sonar Calibrado. With his sophmore album, Dirty Bomb, Filastine returns with a gritty transnational soundclash of urban rhythm. Freely splicing dubstep with balkan brass or hiphop with bollywood, Dirty Bomb parties in the mud puddle of our increasingly polluted world. Kick drums beat out rapid patterns for dances yet to be invented. Rich acoustic strings merge with programmed synths. Bits of field recordings and radio static degrade the signal. Each featured voice is sourced from an on-site collaboration. Over the contorted crunk of \"Hungry Ghosts\" rap aboriginal Australian Wire mc and Japan's ECD, underground icons of their respective countries. Closing the album is teen gypsy La Perla, recorded in a squatted cave in Andalusia. If it's otherworldly melodies with female vocals you want, try tracks 5 and 17. for low-end bangers enhanced by MCs, try tracks 7, 8, and 11. For beautiful instrumentals, tracks 14 and 16. Before focusing on solo work Filastine founded the Infernal Noise Brigade, a 20-piece marching band that was the soundtrack of the globalization protests that opened this century, starting with the blockade of the Seattle WTO summit. The Infernal Noise Brigade was purpose-built to bring music to political movements in the street. Filastine is a project to do the reverse, pumping the immediacy of the street through sound systems. Filastine will spend 2009 touring the world along his DIY trade routes. Expect to find him everywhere.

I used to host a Sunday evening show and we met one time at the studio.I am interested in how you layer the sounds. I found some of the CDs on your 2/10 playlist on Amazon but now have to assume you were layering tracks. Curious about your playlist. On 2/10, I tuned in at about 9:30 and was very impressed despite my hither-to strong reservations about much electronica. You created a really a nice mix that was not dragged down by a too-obvious 4/4 beat. (I can't handle too much 4/4 on floor.) Will send my email address to you via your name since KBOO may not be OK with my posting it here., 21072=Balkan beatbox - Featured artistIsraeli saxophonist Ori Kaplan has been a fixture on New York City's downtown music scene since the early 1990s, playing with gypsy punk band Gogol Bordello and the ethno-garage outfit Firewater. He and Firewater drummer/producer Tamir Muskat split off in 2005 to form Artist. As the name suggests, their music is highly danceable, and takes the melting pot approach of the members' previous bands to the next level, giving the traditional sounds of various Middle Eastern and Eastern European styles an au courant electronica polish. A bit hipper than most world fusion acts, the duo (who perform live with a large ensemble of guest musicians) don't just graft traditional sounds to modern--they have alchemized a style all their own. \u00a0, 92517=\u00a0Any chance we could get the playlist for September 22nd?
