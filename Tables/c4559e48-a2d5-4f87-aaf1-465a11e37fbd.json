What helps to vary the results is the appearance not merely of a few Why Call It Anything tracks, but also regular live and studio guest Kwasi Asante, who turns up not only on \"Miracles and Wonders\" but songs like \"Caution\" and \"Splitting in Two\" (here spiked with snippets from bands like Joy Division and the Fall). The enthusiastic crowd cheers help to seal the overall atmosphere of the disc, while the inclusion of a few semi-acoustic cuts from a separate German show makes for a fine bonus \u2014 especially considering Burgess' claim that the Academy version of \"Soul in Isolation\" was scrapped because Fielding's guitar \"went flying into the audience\" during the performance. The version here has its own dark power, not least because of Burgess' contextually chilling use of references from everything from David Bowie to the Taliban., 116356=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
