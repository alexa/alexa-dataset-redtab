His best time is only down to about 28 milliseconds and the therapist suggests that we take a break for a month and then resume with a few more sessions. Has anyone else had a child with dyspraxia who went through IM therapy and with what success in getting low scores? We've seen huge improvement in his sports skills and there seems to be improvement in his working memory and ability to focus. If there are more gains to be made I'm willing to pursue them but was wondering how realistic it is for a child with dyspraxia to achieve scores below 20 ms. Thanks.", ""]], "pageTitle": "IM and dyspraxia | LD OnLine", "title": "", "url": "http://www.ldonline.org/xarbb/topic/15538", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042988458.74/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002308-00258-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 551602994, "recordOffset": 551594792, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{11425=\u00a92015 WETA.
