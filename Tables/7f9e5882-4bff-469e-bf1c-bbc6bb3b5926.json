This came to 20 nodes in the unweighted case, and 21 nodes in the other four cases. The usersince numbers are linearly scaled. The lasttime (\"last seen\") numbers are scaled by an inverse-log formula, which gives recently active users a huge benefit. (But remember, it's never more than twice what a luser would have.) The XP and numwriteups numbers were log-scaled, to make more difference at the lower end of the scales. That is, the amount of additional benefit for having more XP/writeups diminishes. In case it matters to some people, the statistics were recalculated with different users \"counting more\" based on various criteria: how recently they were active, how long they've been a user, how many nodes they've authored, and how many XP they have. In all cases, the weighting scheme is normalized so that the maximum extra weight (or \"vote\", if you want to think of it that way) is capped at 1. That is, someone with no extra weight (a \"worst case\" user) has 1 vote, and someone with maximum extra weight has 2 vote. Note that this is a continuous scale. Someone in the middle could have 1.573 vote. Go down to see a different view of the same data.
