The coolest time to visit is from November to January. This is also the driest time, and the main festival period, so it\u2019s an interesting time to travel through Laos. The wet season runs from June to October.

The 1960s proved to be a devastating time for the people of Laos, with their nation gaining the dubious honour of being the most bombed country in the world. The United States bombed Laos extensively in an attempt to eradicate North Vietnamese sanctuaries, and sadly contemporary Laos is still dealing with huge amounts of unexploded ordnance (UXO) that is littered throughout the countryside. A coalition government was set up in 1962, but in 1975 Laos became a Communist state when the king gave up his throne in favour of a president and prime minister being instated. During the late 1970s, many people of Laos fled to neighbouring countries as refugees, as trade embargoes from foreign nations led to widespread poverty and disadvantage. By the 1990s, Laos had become a full member of ASEAN and foreign nations had lifted their trade embargoes, which allowed free enterprise to grow.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading To learn more or donate, go to: www.theintrepidfoundation.org This organisation was created to reduce the number of casualties caused by unexploded ordinance (UXO) that still lies on much of Laos\u2019 land.
