Maybe it\u2019s pride, or maybe it\u2019s just about being tough. But a true surgeon never admits they need help, unless absolutely necessary. Surgeons don\u2019t need to ask for help because they are tougher than that. Surgeons are cowboys, rough around the edges, hardcore. At least that\u2019s what they want you to think. Derek: She doesn't let me take care of her. That's not my job anymore. She won't let me. Cristina: I'm taking care of her. Meredith: I can't stop, Cristina. I can't stop seeing Derek. It's not about the sex. It's not about the sex, it's about that moment afterward. The world stops, just feels so safe, so safe. I'm not ready to give that up. Does that make me sad, weak, and pathetic? Cristina: A little bit. Meredith: What do I do? Cristina: I don't know. Mark: What exactly is a gentlemen's evening? Derek: I don't know. It's an evening, with gentlemen. Mark: And strippers? Derek: Nah, I don't think the Chief meant strippers. Mark: Sure sounds like strippers. Dr. Bailey?
