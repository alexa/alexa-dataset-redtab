Little Voice was 50 minutes of piano-and-vocal pop perfection. And as flawless as the album was, I'm happy to say that Kaleidoscope Heart isn't just \"more of the same.\" True, the album has a unique-to-Sara sound throughout its entirety, but this time around, there's far more variation, from the horns in \"King of Anything\" to the accordion in \"Basket Case,\" from the 5-layered vocal harmonies in \"Kaleidoscope Heart\" to the pizzicato strings in \"Uncharted,\" there's something solely unique about each track. Sara's voice is as pitch-perfect as ever, and anyone who's ever seen her live knows that's no feat of computer-aged voice processing like the majority of current pop stars. Sara's voice is what sets her apart from the masses, and although there's no signature high-holding notes like the ones she pulls off in 2007's \"Come Round Soon\" and \"Gravity,\" there is nevertheless an overwhelming presence of her beautiful and soulful voice in each track. And while her voice is still undeniable, it's the composer and lyricist in Sara that really shines on Kaleidoscope Heart. The tracks are more complex and the lyrics more thoughtful, and while I find a mere couple of duds (\"Say You're Sorry\" and \"Machine Gun\" don't do much for me personally), the rest of the album is just as exceptional as Little Voice. Personal favorites are the incredibly energetic \"Gonna Get Over You\" (haven't played it for a single person that hasn't loved it), the somber and heartbreaking \"Breathe Again\", the funky \"Not Alone\", and the reflective \"Basket Case\" (which took some warming up to but is now a favorite). But the whole album is worth repeated listens, and already it's been on repeat more than any album I've ever had - since Little Voice, that is. 5 stars for an always-changing-yet-still-flawless Sara Bareilles., 132840=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
