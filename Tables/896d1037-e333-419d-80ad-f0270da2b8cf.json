Most are spring blooming but there are a few that bloom all year. They range in size from tiny miniatures to large plants like B.'Freddie' that can have 3 foot leaves under optimum conditions (one growing outdoors in Hawaii grew that large). The plants can also grow very large across but don't reach great height, because they grow from rhizomes that creep along the ground, which gives this type its name. The\u00a0 rhizomatous types are popular all across the country and one in particular B.'Erythrophylla' is an early hybrid that was often called it a beef steak or pond lily begonia because of it's large round leaves. Some types of rhizomatous have intricate patterns on their leaves in almost any earth tone color, some are hairy leaved, some are round and shiny, and some are star shaped. There is really no end to the variety of leaf shape, color and texture in this type of begonia, there is something for every taste.
