To build SciTE, Scintilla must first be built. *** GTK+/Linux version *** You must first have GTK+ 2.0 or later and GCC (4.1 or better) installed. GTK+ 1.x will not work. Other C++ compilers may work but may require tweaking the make file. To build Scintilla, use the makefile located in the scintilla/gtk directory cd scintilla/gtk make cd ../.. To build and install SciTE, use the makefile located in the scite/gtk directory cd scite/gtk make make install This installs SciTE into $prefix/bin. The value of $prefix is determined from the location of Gnome if it is installed. This is usually /usr if installed with Linux or /usr/local if built from source. If Gnome is not installed /usr/bin is used as the prefix. The prefix can be overridden on the command line like \"make prefix=/opt\" but the same value should be used for both make and make install as this location is compiled into the executable. The global properties file is installed at $prefix/share/scite/SciTEGlobal.properties. The language specific properties files are also installed into this directory. To remove SciTE make uninstall To clean the object files which may be needed to change $prefix make clean The current make file only supports static linking between SciTE and Scintilla. *** Windows version *** A C++ compiler is required. Visual Studio .NET 2010 is the development system used for most development although TDM Mingw32 4.4.1 is also supported.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
