This rapper has a laid back approach, much like you'd expect from early Snoop Dogg and does a great job to rhyme over solid, unique beats. It's simple at times, it's complex at times, it's a fully interesting album. This is one of the best, real hip hop records you're going to hear. There's no pretense, it's just real music for real people. You owe it to yourself to listen to this one. Great! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by iPeash This nig got funny nursery and sophisticated rhymes on top notch beats.
