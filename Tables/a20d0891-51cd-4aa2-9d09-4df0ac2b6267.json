It plays with the prowess of a greatest hits compilation \u2014 every single song here is simply outstanding and worthy of single status. The slow- burning title-track opens to reveal how Booker T. & The M.G.\u2019s played a huge part in influencing Art Neville\u2019s versatility on the Hammond B-3 organ; he could go from a key-paddling rhythmic style to unhinged, grinding leads at the drop of a beat. Even in moments of minimalism and restraint, songs like \u201cRigor Mortis\u201d can\u2019t explain how a band this tight can also sound so loose. Drummer Joseph Modeliste\u2019s knack for second-line rhythms are especially prominent on \u201cThinking,\u201d where even the most rhythmically challenged of people can learn how to clap on the two instead of on the one. \u201cFunky Miracle\u201d makes good on its title with one of the best illustrations of the Meters\u2019 chemistry in kinetic motion, especially the relationship between their rhythm section and guitar, which Leo Nocentelli plays, sounding as if he had invented a style that could be called \u201clead rhythm.\u201d, 128199=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
