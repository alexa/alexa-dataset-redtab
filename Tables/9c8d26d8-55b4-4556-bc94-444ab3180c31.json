These rarities, less known by definition, are sometimes silly, sometimes dead-on and usually quite fun. The Ramones cover is a latter day cut (\u201cOutsider\u201d). The Kinks cover is a straightforward take on \u201cTired of Waiting For You\u201d where Green Day\u2019s usual British intonations are muted. Both, however, kick with this Berkeley trio\u2019s unpretentious and uncompromising attack. \u201cDon\u2019t Wanna Fall In Love\u201d sounds like a hit from a bygone era. \u201cEspionage\u201d rips like the surf instrumental \u201cPipeline\u201d with the \u201cBatman Theme\u201d thrown into the mix. \u201cI Want To Be On TV\u201d smacks with a fun-lovin\u2019 goofy punk vibe reminiscent of \u201880s punk groups who used their songwriting prowess to poke fun at society and themselves. \u201cScumbag\u201d and \u201cSick Of Me\u201d are more like traditional Green Day fare and further proof of the band\u2019s prolific nature.
