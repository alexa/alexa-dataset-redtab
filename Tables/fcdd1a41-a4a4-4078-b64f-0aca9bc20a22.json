Despite being one of the first signings to ex-Motown songwriters Holland-Dozier-Holland's Invictus label, the trio did not compose most of the Chairmen's early material.

Not surprisingly, the earliest material is Motown-oriented, but what makes the music noteworthy is the rotation of lead vocalists. The set is notable due to excellent remastering and its ability to dig deeper into the Chairmen's catalog due to its extended length. That's especially apparent in the Sly Stone-penned \"Life and Death in G & A, Pts. 1-2,\" a nifty \u2014 if dated \u2014 psychedelic soul suite that is usually truncated on other collections. Most impressive, though, is the Chairmen's diversity, restlessly shifting from sweet-and-sour soul to grinding funk, rousing gospel, lovely ballads, pop, swamp rock, and even a convincing Chicago blues romp, \"Weary Traveler,\" played as raw and tough as many established blues bands. Better yet, there aren't many missteps throughout this compilation's two-hour playing time. The orchestration, overblown production, and extended spoken word section of Burt Bacharach's \"Only Love Can Break a Heart\" seem to aim for Isaac Hayes' Hot Buttered Soul territory and teeter near pretension, but otherwise there are few weak moments. The liner notes are adequate yet don't note who sings lead on each track, a major omission. Otherwise, this set is pretty close to perfect, capturing all the highlights and hidden gems from one of soul music's finest vocal acts, and that's saying a lot.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:55:50 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "\u00d6ppna iTunes n\u00e4r du vill provlyssna, k\u00f6pa och h\u00e4mta musik.
