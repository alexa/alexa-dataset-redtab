It's all genres of music from East Asia, like South Korean pop and hip-hop, Chinese pop, Japanese rock, Mongolian throat music, and songs in which artists sing in different languages (like Koreans singing in Chinese). Through the Word of the Day, I teach Japanese, Chinese, and Korean words. Wok n' Roll presents a blend of the best of East Asian music from past to present!
