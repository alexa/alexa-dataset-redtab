Further to this, a damaging hurricane hit the colony in 1931 causing loss of life and infrastructure. In 1964, Belize was granted the right to self-govern, with George Price becoming the country\u2019s first Prime Minster. Nine years later, British Honduras was officially renamed Belize and in 1981, Belize was granted its independence. More recently, Belize elected its first black Prime Minister when Dean Barrow was sworn in to office in 2008., 64653=Once part of the great Mayan Empire, Belize was occupied for centuries before the Spanish arrived. The Spanish colonists were largely unsuccessful when first trying to colonise Belize as they were repelled by local inhabitants. However, the British arrived in the 17th century and Belize soon became a part of the British Empire under the name of British Honduras (after many battles with Spanish settlers). Prior to the abolition of the slave trade in 1838, many African slaves were sent to Belize to work in the timber industry, namely mahogany extraction. Conditions were tough and fraught with danger, but many slaves chose to stay in this line of work after their emancipation due to their inability to receive work elsewhere or own land. Belize\u2019s current population reflects the rich African culture that the slaves brought to the area centuries ago., 55824=Belize\u2019s subtropical climate sees high temperatures and humidity most of the year, but the fresh sea breezes generally make life more comfortable. The dry season is from December to May, and this is the best time to visit Belize if you\u2019re looking for sunshine and warm temperatures. The wet season is from June to November where rain is more frequent. Belize can get quite busy during the main holidays of Christmas and Easter so be prepared to share the beaches with other travellers during this time., 74282=Starting in the first week of September, Belize National Day kicks off a three-week period of raucous festivities featuring parades, parties, fireworks and feasts in celebration of Belize\u2019s independence. All night beach parties and dancing all round!}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading 7. The precious reefs of Belize need to be preserved and protected.
