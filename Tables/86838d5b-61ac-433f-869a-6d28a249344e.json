It's a great song and $3.99 for 6 songs is definitely a great buy. Keep it up Needtobreathe!!!!! KYEO + B-sides. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by sara_m Not sure that NEEDTOBREATHE ever fails... the music is great, and choosing to add a few of the b-sides to the EP was a nice touch. I'd been able to hear Cops and Disaster Road thanks to the vinyl release of The Reckoning, but it's so great to have these tracks available in mp3 form. Plus? Solomon's Ashes is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. Love this EP. So solid!
