Shields' unique tunings, tremolo, and miking techniques stand out on \"You Never Should\" and \"Nothing Much to Lose,\" but Deb Googe's surprisingly funky bassline on \"Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside)\" reaffirms that all of the Valentines contributed to their innovative sound. Indeed, many of Isn't Anything's disturbingly beautiful highlights come from Bilinda Butcher. On the wrenching \"No More Sorry,\" she sings abstractly pained lyrics like \"Your septic heart and deadly hand/Loved me black and blue,\" barely audible over a swarm of fragile yet menacing guitars, while on \"Several Girls Galore\" she's sexy, yet dazed and distant; it sounds like she's whispering in your ear outside of a blaring nightclub. The Valentines' dark side is especially prominent on the album, particularly on \"Sueisfine,\" where the chorus slyly morphs from \"Sue is fine\" to \"Suicide.\" Isn't Anything captures My Bloody Valentine's revolutionary style in its infancy and points the way to Loveless, but it's far more than just a dress rehearsal for the band's moment of greatness.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:42:39 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Open iTunes to preview, buy and download music.
