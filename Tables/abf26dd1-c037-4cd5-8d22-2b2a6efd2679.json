The songs were sharp and acerbic, a worm's-eye view of an entropic Cleveland, an urban area that was then a dying industrial city. Songs like \"Life Stinks\" and \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" (both later recorded by Pere Ubu) were indicative of the boredom, anomie, and restlessness felt by the city's pre-punk punks. A mercurial band given to constant internal conflict, Rocket from the Tombs was a group always at odds with itself. One example was the Crocus Behemoth issue; outside of Laughner, no one else in the band could stand his singing (or non-singing, as the case may be). Compounding this were Laughner and Behemoth's arty proclivities, which clashed with the hard rock/heavy metal direction preferred by the rest of the band. In 1975, a scrawny, Iggy-worshipping kid from Youngstown, Ohio named Stiv Bators came to Cleveland and was tried out as lead singer, but he didn't last. Laughner, meanwhile, had met and become friendly with influential rock scribe and fellow gonzo Lester Bangs after sending Bangs a Rocket demo tape that he reviewed favorably for Creem. Soon Laughner was writing for Creem and traveling to New York for a first-hand look at the punk scene at CBGB's. Blown away by Patti Smith and especially Television, Laughner returned to Cleveland only to find that the issue of musical direction was tearing RFTT apart. Within weeks, the band was no more., 8489=Laughner and Behemoth (who at this point was going by his birth name, David Thomas) began Pere Ubu, while Gene O'Connor (then called Cheetah Chrome) and Johnny Madansky (then Johnny Blitz) had wisely remembered to keep Bators' phone number; they called him up and formed the wonderfully scuzzy Dead Boys. Laughner's time as a member of Pere Ubu was short, and by 1976, he was fronting a series of new bands, among them Friction, the Finns, and Peter & the Wolves. Despite this flurry of creativity, which included a good chunk of writing for Creem, Laughner was fueling a substance abuse problem that had reached critical mass, and by 1977, he was dead of liver failure at the age of 25. Both Pere Ubu and the Dead Boys went on to have respectable careers (Ubu more so than the Boys), but the sad legacy of Rocket from the Tombs is that of Peter Laughner, an extremely talented man who didn't live long enough to see his talent rewarded. Over 25 years after their initial demise, the surviving members \u2014 bolstered by Television's Richard Lloyd, Laughner's replacement \u2014 defied the odds by regrouping for an exhilarating June 2003 tour, documented on Rocket Redux. In 2010, this same lineup reconvened in Cleveland for recording sessions. The results were released a year later as Barfly.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{61275=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
