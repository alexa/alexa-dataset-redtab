All rights reserved., 30652=By 1987 the Cure were among the most successful \u201calternative\u201d rock bands in the world. Their previous album, 1985\u2019s The Head on the Door, had been a massive hit and expectations were high. After years of single-minded leadership, Robert Smith was opening the band up to be more of a democracy and the additional input of his fellow bandmates led to such an overabundance of material that the group determined Kiss Me would need to be a double album. From the long instrumental passages that add to the album\u2019s intense, epic mood to the ornate, \u201880s psychedelic flourishes that color the tracks, Kiss Me is a headphone listener\u2019s dream. \u201cWhy Can\u2019t I Be You?\u201d and \u201cJust Like Heaven\u201d are the obvious radio-friendly pop songs, while \u201cThe Kiss,\u201d \u201cIf Only Tonight We Could Sleep,\u201d \u201cHow Beautiful You Are\u2026\u201d and \u201cThe Perfect Girl\u201d reflect the heavy romance that replaced the group\u2019s earlier unnerving despair. Emotions continue to dominate with overstated urgency, but it\u2019s with a bit more sense of play.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 04:26:19 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "View In iTunes Mixed Up 5.
