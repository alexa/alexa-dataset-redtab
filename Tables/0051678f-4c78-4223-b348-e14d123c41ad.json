His earnest brand of classic blues struck a strong chord in the midst of so much overproduced music of the day, and as they had done decades before, Brits lined up for the simple pleasures of American blues, which led Steve to a major-label release which quickly made it into the Top 10. While some fans (and critics) had worried that major-label production would kill the bare-bones aesthetic that really made Steve's music shine, that proved a non-issue for the most part. I Started Out with Nothin' and I Still Got Most of It Left opens with the title track, probably the most produced piece present. It's a simple thumping blues in the vein of John Lee Hooker, with some nice but unnecessary vocals courtesy of Ruby Murray. Steve's voice is smooth, almost sensual compared to the gravelly gutbucket one might have been expecting. The production doesn't get in the way of the music too much, though the overall effect is a bit more grandiose than Steve's sound really would call for. Luckily, the sound gets decidedly less smooth as the album moves along, emphasizing Steve's aesthetic", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
