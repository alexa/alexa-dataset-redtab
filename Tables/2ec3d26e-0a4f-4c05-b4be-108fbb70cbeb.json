Her music is rich with drama, calling up touchstones like Ray Orbison, PJ Harvey, and her idol, Edith Piaf. Genres like flamenco, goth, and the blues\u2014plus cinematic influences like James Bond theme songs and the dark visions of David Lynch\u2014are also apparent. After becoming her fan (and unofficial mentor), Brian Eno joined her in the studio to record backup vocals on two of the strongest tracks: \u201cDesire\u201d and \u201cSuzanne & I.\u201d The album is produced by PJ Harvey producer and collaborator Rob Ellis. Calvi's best when she shepherds her disparate influences and powerful, intense voice into the rock arena, as she does on the tracks mentioned above and on the galloping \u201cBlackout\u201d and the spaghetti western\u2013spiced \u201cI\u2019ll Be Your Man.\u201d Nick Cave asked Calvi to join him on Grinderman\u2019s 2010 tour, and a finer double bill is hard to imagine., 23074=Born: 24 September 1980 in Twickenham, England, 123476=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
