With the collapse of European communism, however, came new calls for Macedonian independence, and the state peacefully ceded from the republic in 1992. Wary of \u2018Macedonia\u2019 being used as the country\u2019s proposed name due to implied claims to Aegean Macedonia, Greece made its objections known and the compromise \u2018The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u2019 was eventually arrived at. Greek ire was re-aroused in 1994, culminating in its enforcement of an economic embargo that was eventually lifted upon Macedonia\u2019s changing of its flag and agreeing to discussions about its name. The country evaded being embroiled in the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, but experienced a potentially catastrophic civil conflict from 1997-2001 over tensions with its sizeable Albanian population. Hostilities were becalmed with a NATO ceasefire, but the Albanian-Macedonian relationship is still a touchy subject that\u2019s best avoided. The same goes for Macedonian-Greek relations due to the still unresolved \u2018naming issue\u2019. And also Macedonian-Bulgarian relations for that matter., 952=Macedonia has a climate somewhere between a transitional continental and Mediterranean climate, which can vary greatly between seasons and regions. The country\u2019s mountainous areas can be subjected to brutally cold winters (December to February), while the lower lying areas can reach 40\u00b0 C during summer (June to September). Between May and September is the best time to visit, unless you\u2019re into skiing., 4346=Back in the good old days, the villagers of Gali\u010dnik had only one day each year where Macedonian couples could get married: 12th July. These days, starry-eyed lovers can take their vows on whichever day they please, but for one lucky couple a traditional wedding ceremony is still a possibility. Held on the weekend closest to the 12th July, the Gali\u010dnik Wedding Festival commemorates the custom with dances, elaborate dress and a horse bridle being placed on the bride as a test of her obedience. Any Macedonian couple that has already been married in a civil service can apply for the role of official couple, with the winning entrant generally being the one with the prettiest bride., 1589=Even by Balkan standards, Macedonia\u2019s history is characterised by complexity and controversy. Going back to the days of Alexander the Great (the country\u2019s favourite son), Macedonia has been pin-balled between external powers, from the Romans to the Byzantines, the Serbs to the Ottoman Turks, the Bulgarians to the Greeks. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until 1991 that the country officially attained its status as an independent nation \u2013 and even that remains a point of contention in certain circles. From the sixth century AD until the fourteenth, the territory was wrestled to-and-fro between the Byzantines, Slavs, Bulgars and Serbs before eventually falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1371. The country remained under Turkish rule until the empire\u2019s decline in the eighteenth century, then was once again split up but this time between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia. Various pushes for independence and \u2018reunion\u2019 with Bulgaria were then stymied by the two World Wars and the advent of communism., 6089=Macedonia\u2019s breweries aren\u2019t as prolific as its wineries, but beer is still a pretty big player in national culture and deemed worthy a festival. The first Pivo Fest Prilep was held in 2003 and, in contrast to many of the country\u2019s other tradition-orientated festivals, the focus here is on live music, grilled meats, skimpy attire and ales abundant. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it\u2019s now one of the most popular summer events in the country., 5110=Each September, Kavadarci, a small town in Macedonia\u2019s seriously scenic wine-growing region, plays host to the Tikve\u0161ki Grozdober festival. A celebration of both the town\u2019s liberation and the beginning of the grape harvest, the festival swells with food stalls and music concerts and culminates in an extravagantly costumed carnival procession through the town\u2019s main streets. Oh, and much wine drinking.}", "textBeforeTable": "Recommended reading Further reading 8. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children. 7.
