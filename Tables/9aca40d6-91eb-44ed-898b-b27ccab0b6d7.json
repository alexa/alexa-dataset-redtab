Edge: Cardinals. Percentage of money on Arizona: 67% (30,000 bets) Seems like a lot of points, doesn't it? It's early, but the public is leaning toward Arizona. The Vegas. Edge: Saints. The Cardinals are red-hot. The Saints are ice-cold after resting their starters and struggling down the stretch. The Psychology. Edge: Cardinals. Arizona is 6-1 against the spread as underdogs this year. I say that improves to 7-1. Not only will the Cardinals cover; I think they win outright. The Saints were already struggling before they rested their starters. Meanwhile, the Cardinals are red-hot. They have extensive playoff experience, and Warner, who is secretly one of the best postseason performers in NFL history, will not be rattled in the Superdome.", "textAfterTable": "Previous Message Next Message Forum List Message List New Topic Print View The Original HERD Rams Moving or Rams Staying Posts Bucky's Pub Jim Everett Chat Kevin Demoff Chat Game Time Forum HERDfest Discussion Help and Support Forum Deacon Jones Chat Thursday April 5th at 9pm est.
