Of course none of that would matter if the songs weren\u2019t as good as they are. Like Clockwork finds Homme and co. in gothic mode, wrapping dark riffs around moody arrangements. \u201cKeep Your Eyes Peeled\u201d struts slowly like an old engine starting, firing off in quick bursts of robot riffery. \u201cThe Vampyre of Time and Memory\u201d sees the band engaging in Queen-style rock cabaret, with Homme likely reflecting on months of medical struggles with typically dark humor (\u201cI survive, I speak I breathe, I\u2019m alive, hurray\u201d). Grohl\u2019s metallic disco beat sends \u201cIf I Had a Tail\u201d sailing smoothly through its troubled waters. The band brings back the desert-rock magic for \u201cMy God is the Sun\u201d and \u201cI Appear Missing,\u201d which will have fans kneeling before them once again after years of quietude from the band. And \u201cFairweather Friends\u201d is a must-hear, with Homme unleashing some of his finest singing and guitarwork to date as Elton John billows the whole thing with his ever-commanding voice.", "textAfterTable": "Side B Titles Artist Length 1.
