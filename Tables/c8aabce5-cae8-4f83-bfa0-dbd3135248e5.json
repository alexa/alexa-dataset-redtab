All rights reserved., 20244=Tiffany. Sigh. Tiffany. Often cast off as an 80s teen queen, people tend to ignore the fact that this girl had, and still has, an amazing voice. While her counterpart Deborah (don't calle me Debbie) Gibson was more respected just cause she wrote and produced her own stuff (but let's face it, while she did do so, it was still \u00fcber cheesy teen pop), she had nothing on Tiffany in the vocals department! Such passion and raw emotion on these songs which were recorded when she was only 14! Fun pop music sung with such conviction and power, yet her main instrument, her voice, is so often ignored. Just listen to heartfelt ballads such as \"Could've Been\" or \"Feelings Of Forever\" and you'll quickly be amazed that such a voice came out of such a young vocalists who still hadn't even reached her peak. Often called a young Stevie Nicks upon her debut, one can hear the influence is tracks like \"Should've Been Me\" or \"Spanish Eyes\". This is by far one of my favorite debut albums of all time. Some songs do sound rather dated (\"Johnny's Got The Inside Moves\") but even still they are just as charming and enticing as they were back when I was 10 in 1987. It's wonderful to see that Tiffany has come so far as a vocalist. Check out her 2000 release (which itunes carries) \"The Color Of Silence\" just to see how far this then little girl with a big voice has come.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 04:14:42 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "View In iTunes The Color of Silence 5.
