Che's inspiring words are seamlessly woven between some tracks like I've never heard before - music is a mix of latin stuff and new sounds from new artists mixing trad with new electronic styles. I listened to track 7 by chance first and that's how I discovered the speeches and audio grabs so I decided to buy the whole album and I got an unreal suprise because there's loads more of his speeches and fun audio mixed up with some cool effects and stuff throughout each track - it's like a non-stop DJ mix so you really gotta buy this one as an album and listen to it as an album to feel the vibe and get up close and personal with the revolutionary himself.
