Bassist Omer Avital, pianist Anat Fort, clarinetist Anat Cohen, and numerous others have made a big splash in New York, Israel, and elsewhere. Anat\u2019s brother, the bassist Avishai Cohen, has played with Danilo Perez, Joshua Redman, Brad Mehldau, and others, and has released a number of his own albums since the late 1990s. Cohen has a warm tone on his instrument, and can say a lot with a handful of notes. On Gently Disturbed he\u2019s joined by the young Israeli pianist Shai Maestro and his longtime rhythm cohort, the American drummer Mark Guiliana, and the trio\u2019s distinctive approach draws from a number of sources. Two traditionals, \u201cLo Baiom Velo Balyla\u201d and \u201cPuncha Puncha,\u201d are just a couple of the tracks that display the influence of classical music, while \u201cEleven Wives\u201d possesses the grandeur of a pop anthem by Radiohead or Coldplay. (It\u2019s easy to imagine Maestro playing keyboards in a rock group.) The off-kilter chug of \u201cPinzin Kinzin\u201d points to an abstracted but far from bloodless take on funk. The album\u2019s highlight might be the title track, where a mysterious piano melody is intriguingly shadowed by Cohen\u2019s bass.
