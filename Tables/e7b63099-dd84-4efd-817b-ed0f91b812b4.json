The four-track Impale Golden Horn begins the collection, logically starting with the song \"Finale,\" a nearly-20-minute combination of contemplation and epic metal guitar crumble; it's not meant to crush but to slowly envelop, drawing a clear distinction between itself and The Invisible Mountain's approach. \"Laughing Celestial Architect\" is the other long drone monster on Impale Golden Horn, a central mantra of guitar tone swathed in feedback that slowly introduces other elegant guitar and drum parts to create a beautiful symphonic effect. The two shorter songs bring out other aspects of Miller's drive for sonic overload; \"The Golden Horn\" itself includes a steady piano part, deep rhythms, and queasy flange along with the feedback, while \"Blood Fountain\" brings both piano and acoustic guitar further to the fore to create a gentle conclusion topped off by understated vocals. The second disc, Forbidden Planet, takes a more explicitly black metal turn from the start with \"Veil of Maya,\" harsh guitar flow, scraggly metallic percussion (played very precisely even so), and swathed vocals all intermingling", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
