The group was started in 1997 when the audition show Asayan (sort of) backfired on Tsunku \u2014 who had hoped to find a bona fide female pop icon, but she (Heike Michiyo) was greeted with a lukewarm reception \u2014 and he decided to take the five runners-up (Natsumi Abe, Kaori Iida|, Asuka Fukuda, Aya Ishiguro, and Yuko Nakazawa) and challenge them to become a successful act. He \"challenged\" them by only agreeing to work with them if they were able to sell 50,000 copies of their demo \u2014 on their own, with television help, of course \u2014 in five days. The group succeeded, and released its first single, \"Morning Coffee,\" in 1998. Their first album, First Time, was released later that year. In 1999, the group experienced for the first time what was to become one of the hallmarks of Morning Musume \u2014 frequent roster changes. Asuka Fukuda left the group, and was replaced with Maki Goto. Over the years, Tsunku has used Morning Musume to create subgroups \u2014 which in some cases have acted as support acts for group tours \u2014 as well as \"graduating\" members of Morning Musume and/or \"retiring\" them. This rotating cast of members has kept the band in the public eye and sales at high numbers. The group (in its various permutations) had released more than 35 singles and around ten albums by 2008. The group has also kept a hectic touring schedule throughout its long life, including package tours, television appearances, and festival outings.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{79918=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
