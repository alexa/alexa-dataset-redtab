It\u2019s also the best time for bird watching, as birds migrate to the lakes of the Rift Valley in large numbers. It\u2019s generally less busy from June to September, but the weather is still dry during this time. Wet season is from March to May and October to December. During this time tourist sites are less crowded, hotels have more rooms available and prices are usually cheaper. The annual wildebeest migration occurs between July and August, and again in October each year. Millions of wildebeest migrate from the Serengeti in search of greener pastures and then return.

The \u201cMau Mau Uprising\u201d of the 1950s was responsible for drawing attention to the plight of the African population, and was also the catalyst for the change in how Kenya is governed. The 1970s saw Kenya\u2019s international economic profile grow due to the successful development of a free-market economy, with agriculture and tourism creating more a more stable economy. More recently, Kenya\u2019s tourism industry has continued to develop and flourish, mainly due to its wealth of exotic animals, national parks, coastal hot-spots and unique cultures. Standards of living have also improved in Kenya, with an overall improvement in life expectancy, infant mortality and fertility rates \u2013 probably due to the increased investment in family planning, education and health by both the Kenyan government and NGOs. Despite this, many Kenyans still live below the poverty line and struggle to provide the bare necessities for themselves and their children.
