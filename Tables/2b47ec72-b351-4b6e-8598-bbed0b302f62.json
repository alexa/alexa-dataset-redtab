Aside from occasional piano lessons, he passed time deep in his own imagination and on spontaneous road trips, a.k.a his mother\u2019s famous mystery van rides, that seem to have provoked his current state of restlessness. Itching to hit the road, The Great Mundane left his hip-hop roots in Michigan to delve into Chicago\u2019s house/techno scene before arriving in the Pacific Northwest. Now based in Portland, Oregon he takes listeners on a journey exploring the complexities and intricacies of his minimalist and innovative approach to beatmaking. He invents fractured, heady instrumentals laced with lush synthesizer work that navigate the terrain of forward thinking hip-hop and electro/house, all while exhibiting genuine emotion and talented production skills. Each arrangement is collaged with friends, found sounds, synthesizers, and samples meticulously programmed to convey what it might feel like to fall in love with a tree, travel through a wormhole, or to never be bored again. His debut LP \u201cWhen Falls Arrive\u201d (psymbolic) was released in 2007 exposing him as one of the top underground electronic musicians to keep an ear out for. Since, he has released \u201cThe Wires Remixes\u201d EP (self-released, 2008), a remix of Deru\u2019s \u201cPeanut Butter and Patience\u201d (Mush, 2009) and his second full length entitled \u201cHumdrum\u201d (RunRiotRecords, 2010). The Great Mundane\u2019s music is featured on a long list of compilation albums including Portland\u2019s annual \u201cPDX Pop Now\u201d series. Expect remixes for SPL, Lorn, KiloWatts & Bluetech as well as his next full length in May 2011 on 1320 Records., 110651=Latest newsletter: May 2015, 13152=Angelides\u2019 performance moniker was inspired by San Francisco experimental music icons The Residents\u2019 1979 album \u201cEskimo\u201d. Drawn to the album\u2019s character-based stories and shamanistic themes, he dropped the title\u2019s middle \u201cI\u201d and launched his Eskmo project in 1999 in his home state Connecticut. Prior to that, in the mid-90s, he was introduced to renegade funk combo Primus and UK breakbeat techno wizards The Prodigy. The music virus soon took hold. He learned to play bass and formed bands while absorbing \u201890s electronic music from Aphex Twin, Frankie Bones, 187, Dieselboy, The Chemical Brothers and Moby among others., 13865=Angelides initially made music to share with friends using a primitive Miracle instructional keyboard, a four-track recorder and a bass guitar. He used a Roland keyboard to record his first formal work, a CD titled \u201cMachines on Task\u201c, for a school graduation project. After high school, between 1999 and 2005, he wrote two full-length albums that he gave away at small shows. During this time he spent two years working on music in a secluded lakeside house in Connecticut. It was there that he also wrote gentler, melodic material released later under his other production alias, Welder., 15451=In early 2006 he was invited to play in San Francisco. He fell in love with the area\u2019s culture, art, music and landscape and relocated to the city soon after. He was immediately embraced by SF\u2019s frenetic electronic producer and label community., 44308=Audi for this broadcast can be found at: http://laruletaradio.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/tito-tablada-flught-ariste..., 12462=In the past five years he\u2019s released over a dozen singles and EPs while touring throughout North America and Europe. He\u2019s also remixed works by diverse artists such as Bibio, Spor, STS9, Bear In Heaven and Bar9, to name a few. Angelides also runs the Ancestor label, which issued his \u201cHypercolor\u201d and \u201cAngus Dei\u201d singles in 2009 to positive reviews from numerous magazines, blogs and tastemakers. Ninja Tune recording artist and film composer Amon Tobin hailed his work as \u201csome of the best production I\u2019ve heard in recent times.\u201d, 14510=Delving into conspiracy theories and moved by the 9/11 attacks, his music took a darker turn. However, by 2005 he grew tired of his remote outpost and emerged to explore new environments and sounds. \u201cThe [conspiracies] were separating me from people,\u201d he says of that period. \u201cI wanted [people] to be motivated to come together and make change, but it had the opposite effect. I realized that music could be a tool to bring people together.\u201d, 15718=One track that caught on big in 2009 was the self-released \u201cHypercolor\u201d. \u201cI wanted to write a tune at 140 bpm,\u201d he says of the beaming, colorful song. \u201cI made [the beat] a triplet pattern and added some Tom Waits-y sounds to it. I wanted it to be a really big sounding track without it being an aggro tune.\u201d The track was featured on the Mary Anne Hobbs\u2018 BBC Radio1 show and was presented by Bleep as one of the top 100 tracks of 2009 in their catalog., 16244=Soon after his remix of Warp\u2019s Bibio was featured in Pitchfork, he was asked by Flying Lotus to perform at the Brainfeeder Sessions in LA alongside Nosaj Thing. Angelides has since joined forces with Amon Tobin in a collaborative music project called \u201cEskamon\u201d that highlights their love of field recoding and unique take on sound manipulation. His first single on Warp entitled \u201cLands and Bones\u201d featuring Swan is set for an early 2010 release on a split single with good friend EPROM., 119074=Copyright \u00a9 2012 KBOO Community Radio | Copyright Policy | Community Guidelines | Website Illustration & Design by: KMF ILLUSTRATION, 11662=ESKMO-Brendan Angelides is a San Francisco based electronic music producer who records and performs live as Eskmo. His multi-genre compositions have been featured on influential labels like Warp Records and Planet Mu (most recently having been signed to the mighty Ninja Tune). While Angelides\u2019 tracks encompass a wide range of electronic styles, he avoids classifications. Bleep.com described his tracks as \u201cMasterfully produced\u2026 sophisticated, post-Dilla hip-hop funk\u201c. His last single of 2009 entitled \u201cLet Them Sing\u201d on Mu was met with equal praise and described by sites like Boomkat as \u201c[Putting] Eskmo on his own electronic plateau.\u201d}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 05:17:34 +0000", "textBeforeTable": "10/20/2010 Air date:\u00a0 A Jazz World Program name:\u00a0 Jazz Categories: A Jazz World playlist for 10/20/2010 Login or register to post comments Much thanks to Todd Bayles for co-hosting, and to listener Chris for being the first person to become a KBOO\u00a0member during my show! \u00a0 The Beatles \u2013 Nowhere Man \u2013 Rubber Soul (Parlophone, 1965) **REQUEST Elvis Costello \u2013 Leave My Kitten Alone \u2013 Kojak Variety (Warner Bros, 1995) The Hollies \u2013 Pay You Back With Interest \u2013 Stop!
