Grab your ska hats, loafers and get ready to skank like a rude girl! First we'll start it off on the island of Jamaica with Miss Rita Marley and her Soulettes. Then we'll hit the streets of the U.K. to listen to what the 2 Tone ladies were doing at the time, like Emily's heroine, Miss Pauline Black. Later on, some ska tracks from Latin America will introduce you to the third wave. Listen for a few surprise tracks from the U.S. along the way! Thank you Radio Antilles.
