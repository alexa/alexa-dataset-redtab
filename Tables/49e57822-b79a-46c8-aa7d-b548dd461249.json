Wood's approach is loving but a bit hampered by its formalism \u2014 much of it feels like the '80s indie rock that in itself was a tribute to '60s rock & roll, and while sound and approach is as sound and approach does, there's almost nothing on the album that hasn't been heard before by any number of bands. As a result, it's the details more than the songs which stand out on Giantess, though often those details are killer, like the stop-start ending and keyboard sparkle on the opening \"Saturday Night,\" a deft shift to Velvets/Modern Lovers-style chug halfway through the winning \"Flex of Green.\" (\"Wheels on Fire\" \u2014 not the Dylan song \u2014 does an even better job with that approach; a whole album in that vein might well have been a good path to try.) \"Einstein of Love\" stands out as the highlight, a slow, heartfelt number with some lovely guitar performances throughout, including a stellar concluding solo. Otherwise, what Giantess feels like in the end is a celebration", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
