At least I now know it is not some confusion of mine and will stop trying. I remember that you mentioned bookmarking services like Delicious.com before. I have never tried one but this can be my 'try something new\" New Year's resolution for 2011. Thanks for the inspirational recipe ideas. cheers Trisha, 15195=This is a site problem. The truth is, I need to update the software that's running the sites really bad (I've only had time to apply security patches) and I just haven't had the time. It doesn't look like I'll have the time until February either, since I have to go on the road in January for book promo activities. For the moment I would recommend using a bookmarking service like Delicious.com, Stumbleupon and so on. Sorry about that!}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 03:33:20 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "New forum activity since your last visit More information about formatting options Web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically.
