In my opinion, don't buy the whole album, just the singles you like, coz although the album is @ a great price, its not worth it. This album may appeal to everyone, but not EVERY track appeals to EVERYONE, if you understand...? Very Enjoyable and at a great price too! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Rammydammy3 This is a really good album, all the tracks are really well produced and all link together well. Stand outs Cupid Shot Me and Standing Tears Apart are brilliant and the rest aren't far behind. Overall a great album at a great price that Im sure will grow on me to make it 5 star!
