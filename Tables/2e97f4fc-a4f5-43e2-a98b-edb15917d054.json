But I'm happy now, and those few seconds (I'm a newbie in racing and half a minute is still just a few seconds) doesn't really change anything! Thanks a mil and I definitely make sure that my number will be notice the next time. Regards, Johana", "Hi Johanna, I've given you an approximate time of 71 mins. I was a little bit conservative in order to ensure fairness to other competitors. The important thing to note for future races is that your number should be clearly visible when you cross the finish line for results recording purposes. Regards, Kevin.", "Thanks guys - the more the merrier.", "Well Mick, you did ask. I've put up a report as well. john", "Mick there is", "There must be a race report out there somewhere?", "No problem Rachel.", "Hi Niamh, thanks a million for holding onto the jacket. See you at maulin. Stephen", "Hi Niamh, thank you. Looking at the pictures of other people I figured out I was somewhere between 69:45 and 70:25. Not to sure where exactly thou. It's partly my own fault, it was my first race and I didn't realise I'm suppose to hand in my number. It'll be great if my correct time is written down somewhere.

My thanks to Niamh and all concerned. The marking was spot on. Just a little gripe - A race competitor passed me along the way with a dog on a lead which I believe is out of order for obvious reasons. Did anyone else spot him?", "Hi, it was my first race ever. I really enjoyed the run and the atmosphere. It was well organised and I had fun. Thought I did really well, it was 12:16 when I checked my phone after finishing. So I was really looking forward to see my result (at about 75 mins or bit less I guess)in compare with the others...and now I'm listed as a second last one, with 127 mins....How did that happened? It spoiled the joy little bit..", "I agree with Mick. Thanks organisers!

Rene Borg helped me but for the moment anyone (just one person but he live in Dun Laoghaire so it's not very good for him). So I'm interested by a lift. I live in Tallaght (near the hospital) but I can move (City center or somewhere else). Thank you very much for your help. Stephane Pradines", "Hi Gary, Great. I am just opposite the Tesco's in Sandymount - so how about I meet you there at 9.45 tomorrow morning. It is in Tesco village. Great if you can email me your number just in case i need to cntact you, Regards, Catherine", "Hi Catherine, I'd love a lift if you've still got space and can help out with petrol etc. Where are you leaving from in Sandymount? Is there somewhere I can park? Alternatively, I can meet you somewhere along the N11 if you can think of anywhere suitable. I've left my car in the Foxrock car park before.

Brendan", "Hi Brendan, Going by your previous experience and times you will be fine for the Tibradden race. As this is your first race just go at your own pace and you will soon get into a comfortable routine. As stated previously, just bring along \u20ac17 (\u20ac10 annual membership / \u20ac7 race fee) and you will be all set to go! Looks like it could be a bit cold / frosty on the day so bring some extra clothes and perhaps and hat and gloves. Have a look at what other people are wearing too and you should be right. Good luck, Gareth", "Hi, I have been thinking of entering a race for a while now. I had planned on starting with maulin but have just seen this race on this weekend. One thing I am concered of is my level of fitness. Would this be a good race to start out in? Any help, advice appreciated. As a bench mark, I ran a 10k road race in phoenix park in 50mins approx the last 2 years, And completed GF6 for the past 2 years in 6 hrs 22 mins (exact time 2 years in a row..!). My fitness is relatively similar to what it was then. Thanks, Brendan", "Hey guys, Anyone planning a doing a recce of the route Thursday evening?

Happy of course to help with petrol etc. Cheers, Gary", "My own recommendations: Bring a range of clothes for last minute decision - take a look at what others are wearing during their warmup. Nice calm day: Shorts Technical running t-shirt Windy cold day: Shorts Longsleeve technical running top Hat Rainy day: Shorts Longsleeve or tech t-shirt Lightweight rain resistant running jacket Hat", "Planning to do my first IMRA run on the 20th of this month. Usually only do road races so looking for any recommendations on clothing. Is it the norm or do you need light running jacket, heavy weather top etc. Cheers, Dave", "I ran recce of route during the week. It is pretty easy to follow. The race will start along the forest road rather than up the way marked Dublin Way, you join the way further up the hill, and follow new trail till you meet Wicklow Way, turn left here, then route is easy to find up to Fairy Castle. Watch out for left turn coming down towards comms masts, this path joins Wicklow Way again at left turn, then you join up with the trail back to Tibradden. Route is mostly on paths with one rocky patch on descent and traverse of Two Rock mountain. Fair climb in the first 2km, then pretty flat until Two Rock. Great route for a Winter League race.", "Hi! I will be leaving from Sandymount village and travelling south along N11 if anyone requires a lift. Leave Sandymount around 9.45 - 3 spaces available. Catherine", "I'm thinking of heading down to do a recce at some stage over the next week or so. As someone with no sense of direction who would have trouble directing a seagull to the coast how easy is the route to find/follow?
