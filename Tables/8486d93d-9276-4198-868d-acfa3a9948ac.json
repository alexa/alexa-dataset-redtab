All rights reserved., 32188=\"Monster Mash\" is one of the all-time great holiday songs, resurfacing (and sometimes charting) every Halloween without fail. The Original Monster Mash is the accompanying Top 20 album from 1962, on which Pickett leads off with his big hit before plying his Boris Karloff shtick for another 15 songs. Pickett's other Top 100 monster hit, the Christmas novelty \"Monsters' Holiday,\" is here as well, along with dated jokes about Fabian (\"Rabian - The Fiendage Idol\") and then-current dance crazes (\"Transylvania Twist,\" \"Skully Gully\"). \"Let's Fly Away\" is a brief Stan Freberg send-up that replaces \"John and Marsha\" with Dracula and Vampira. The Crypt-Kickers were an all-star band that counted Leon Russell, producer Gary Paxton, and other famous folks among its members, and the album remains a fine Halloween party platter year and years later. Unfortunately, the album was remixed for CD release in 1991, and the vocals are obscured in the mix so that the generic rock backing often prevails over the \"spooky\" dialogue and singing, which defeats the point for a novelty effort such as this.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 03:46:05 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "View In iTunes Monster Mash (Remastered) - Single 4.
