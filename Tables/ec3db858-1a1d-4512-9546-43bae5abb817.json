This album is great from start to finish and it ranges from subtle piano pieces to electronic upbeat tracks. It's actually hard to pigeonhole but if you want to be lost in an amazing variety of cinematic sounds, give it a go, you won't be disappointed. 5 stars \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Diamondelite49 WOW, I love this album! First heard The Truth on Soundcloud and was just hooked. Every track has its own personality and you get taken on a roller coaster of emotions. The vocal tracks are particularly nice. I look forward to more. Well done RJ! Cinetronique \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by The toole 476", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
