Gleason, these live recordings of Bob Dylan from the 1963 Brandeis University Folk Festival catch the future legend at an interesting juncture. He had recorded, but not released, his second album, The Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan, which featured his first collection of original material. (His first album had only two originals.) The concert is not a promotion for his new album \u2014 though it does feature a chilling version of \u201cMasters of War.\u201d There are three \u201ctalkin\u2019\u201d tunes based on the old folk and blues traditions of his hero, Woody Guthrie that are bright and humorous and highly political. A concert staple, \u201cBallad of Hollis Brown,\u201d which would finally appear on Dylan\u2019s third album, The Times They Are-A Changin\u2019\u201d, is fierce and frightening. In just a few short months, Bob Dylan would become a folk hero, and within a few years a rock singer and songwriter beyond compare., 74769=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
