In that time, they've never strayed very far from their transcendent gospel harmonies and earnest churchy message, performing at rallies for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and collaborating with everyone from Peter Gabriel to Blackalicious, winning six Grammy awards and being nominated for even more. This newest record finds the group working with Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, whose own brand of earnest and often uplifting spirituality is a natural fit for the Boys, who he pairs with a number of contemporary singers possessing their own powerful spiritual sentiments. Members of tUnE-yArDs and My Brightest Diamond appear and fit right in with this earnest stripped down and casually efficient version of the gospel spiritual. 09/29/2013 Amoeba Review Vinyl LP Also available in: SHIPS FREE in U.S. $13.98 BUY The Blind Boys Of Alabama I'll Find A Way (CD) Tweet", "textAfterTable": "BUY $13.98 SHIPS FREE in U.S. Also available in: LP User Reviews Overall Rating 0 Submissions RATE & REVIEW Who We Are Amoeblog Buy Sell Trade News & Contests Gift Certificates Contact Us Support & FAQ Sign-up for email news, sales alerts & more:", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
