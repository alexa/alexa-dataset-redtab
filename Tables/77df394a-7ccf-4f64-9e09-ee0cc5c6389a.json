When all else seemed lost, a mystical woman named Alice appeared, using her own brew of the enchantresses' dangerous magic against them to send them back to their own world. While all has been relatively peaceful since Alice sealed them all away, rumor has it that the Witch Queen still lurks beneath the surface world, waiting to take back the world that was almost hers. \"}", "textBeforeTable": "Recently the Dengeki site restructured several of their regular features, including the Top 50 weekly sales rankings. It's now the Top 20, and a few other alterations have made it much less easy to work with. So for a while I'm going with the Famitsu Top 30 sales list to see how it goes.

I'm not sure why the PSP, or handhelds in general, should attract so many tactical titles, but here's one more to add to the list. So far, at least nine characters from various editions of the original game are known to be in this version, as well as two original characters, Cute and Jeanne. What strikes me as interesting is the actual combat sequence when two units engage. The game shows its roots here, as it goes into what looks like a fighting game mode, complete with health bar along the top. I'm not sure how far the fighting game style goes, however. That is something I'll have to look into. What I'd rather not look into is the nature of that pink goop splattered over one character on the first page of the scan. Some things are better left unknown. Source: Famitsu Weekly Witchy Woman We have news of A Witch's Tale!
