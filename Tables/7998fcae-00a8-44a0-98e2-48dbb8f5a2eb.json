Original bassist Kim Deal dropped out of the running, with session bassist Ding now handling her duties. So this technically isn\u2019t the classic Pixies. But as far as Frank Black albums go, this is a strong entry. These songs first appeared in a series of EPs, a gentle way of coaxing listeners back to the fold that also let the group make last-minute tinkerings to their work. The songs themselves feel much more accessible. Black appears to understand where their sound turned the commercial corner. He still snarls and screams with the best of them, and the guitars are turned mean and nasty by longtime Pixies producer Gil Norton. \u201cWhat Goes Boom\u201d is an immediate battle between Black and lead guitarist Joey Santiago. \u201cGreens and Blues\u201d is more accommodating. \u201cBagboy\u201d nods toward The Fall, an alternative band even more influential than The Pixies who\u2019ve been shuffling lineups\u2014and confounding expectations\u2014for decades.
