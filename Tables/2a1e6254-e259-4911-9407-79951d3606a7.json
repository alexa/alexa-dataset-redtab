By 1995's Devil in the Details, guitarist Jason Bieler was firmly in the driver's seat, as this was the second album on which he did double duty as the group's lead singer. And once more, Devil in the Details turned out to be a varied album that brings to mind Extreme, King's X, and Queen. Another sweet and sappy acoustic ditty is included (\"Spanish Rain\"), as well as an old-tyme pop tune (\"Victoria\") and the expected headbanging rockers (\"Killing Ground\"). Fans of the band's first few albums will dig it, but it appeared as though rock radio circa the mid-'90s was as far removed as you could possibly get from Saigon Kick's brand of all-encompassing rock.
