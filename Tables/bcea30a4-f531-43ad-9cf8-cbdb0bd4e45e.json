Feeding the hype machine, Dom's frontman (also named Dom) ruffled critics\u2019 feathers by admitting that he strove to be \u201cthe Madonna of garage rock.\u201d Madonna comparisons are a big stretch, and garage rock is a term that fits loosely, but there is no question that the quintet's freshman outing is a deliberate \u2014 and deliberately slack \u2014 attempt at conventional pop. The punchy hook \u201cit\u2019s so sexy to be living in America\u201d and the anthemic three-chord pep of \u201cBochicha\u201d are immediate standouts, but each track is similarly catchy, in a synthesized indie pop vibe that mirrors the bouncy sleekness of Jaguar Love\u2019s Hologram Jams or any number of Dom's Astralwerks labelmates. It would be easy to interpret Sun Bronzed Greek Gods as overly processed or too insincere, but the songs\u2019 bright textures, insistent beats, and sweet harmonies make them very buttery to the palate. Sometimes, that\u2019s enough. Customer Reviews Love It!!!<3 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
