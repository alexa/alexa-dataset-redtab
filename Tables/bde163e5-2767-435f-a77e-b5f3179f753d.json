Amarantine may have paled in comparison to Watermark or Shepherd Moons, but its under-produced (in Enya-world) balladry was a small leap forward for the reclusive Irish superstar. 2008's And Winter Came follows in the same footsteps as Amarantine, but it hints at the grandeur of earlier recordings, specifically 1994's Christmas EP.

Enya, lyricist Roma Ryan, and producer Nicky Ryan have crafted a pleasant little snow globe of an album that sounds exactly like one would expect from the longtime collaborators.

There are copious amounts of \"stars in the skies\" and \"bells ringing,\" and even a surprising left turn (maybe even a complete u-turn) near the end on \"My! My! Time Flies!,\" a straight-up \"Beatlesque\" pop tune with drums and a screaming guitar solo that sounds like something off of a late-'60s Bee Gees record. As usual, Enya fans will be pleased with the results while non-believers will find that the same arguments against her are still valid, but in the end And Winter Came is an undeniably welcome addition to the holiday season, if only for its effortless, white, spray-painted pinecone elegance and potpourri-scented, gift shop comforts.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:57:34 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Open iTunes to preview, buy and download music.
