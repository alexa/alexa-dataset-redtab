That album, like the pseudonym adopted to mask the ostensible solo nature of Abasi's new project, was Animals as Leaders, and it proceeded to showcase the guitarist's formidable mastery of his instrument through a wholly instrumental, daringly progressive, and, perhaps most surprisingly, oftentimes mellow and ambiently new agey collection of songs. Of course, Abasi's heavy metal proving ground inevitably takes charge on more aggressive, maniacally intense workouts like \"Tempting Time,\" \"Thoroughly at Home,\" and \"CAFO\" \u2014 all of which make reference to extreme explorers like Cynic and Meshuggah. But kinder ruminations like \"Soraya,\" \"On Impulse,\" and \"Point to Point\" take a different approach by weaving cascading melodies and fleet-fingered tapping (somewhere between Joe Satriani and two-hand-tap trailblazer Stanley Jordan) out of his customized seven- and eight-string guitars. Meanwhile, overt electronics are kept to a bare minimum aside from the programmed drums and occasional electronic hiccups (\"On Impulse\"), fluttering synth patterns (\"Song of Solomon\"), and overdriven synthetic percussion runs (\"The Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing\") that", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
