New Junk Aesthetic, the group's debut on Epitaph Records (after a long tenure on indie Ferret Music), found the group further refining its signature approach with a new sonic clarity and an occasional focus on melodic hooks. That said, the Buffalo, NY-based combo remains bone-crushingly intense, with songs such as \"The Marvelous Slut,\" \"Organ Grinder,\" and \"Who Invented the Russian Soldier\" characterized by math rock-like stop-on-a-dime rhythmic shifts and vocalist Keith Buckley's surprisingly comprehensible throat-shedding. Other tracks, however, such as \"Turtles All the Way Down\" and first single \"Wanderlust\" draw a bit more from a traditional rock bag, with radio-ready, old-school, grunge-esque choruses, and catchy, relatively straightforward six-string riffs. Throughout, Every Time I Die sounds energized and passionate, delivering its blend of old and new sounds with a directness that gives the ferocious music an unusually broad appeal.
