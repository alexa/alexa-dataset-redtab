That's the Sound Stone he's... umm, levitating (note the sound wavelength spanning the stone's main face), although this was before I became aware that the stone is supposed to look like a rainbow-colored conch shell (a'la the EB Zero Magicant houses or the God's Tail rocks). Big deal, I guess... I've always thought of it as a flat, shale-like stone, so that's how I'm presenting it.", "kenisu - #25 Ah, it's good to begin Chapter 1 at last. I pulled a genuine, classic college all-nighter to finish this one. Anyway, it's anyone's guess as to why Ninten, an all-American boy, is reading a Japanese-language manga. Also, I'm beginning to question if it really was a good idea to give Mick (the family dog) the ability to stand on his hind legs as his sprite in the game seems to suggest.", "kenisu - #26 Sorry about how pale the colors are and everything... up until now, I've been using the superb scanners at my university, but now that I'm home from college, my so-so standard scanner will have to do. My winks to the 80's continue. Basically, I'm giving Ninten the sort of fandom that I was into back then (although I was 6 in 1988, whereas Ninten is supposed to be 12, so I have to take each medium's target age into account), and Garfield and ALF were just two of the things I remember the 80's for. As for the San Francisco Giants, I've never been much of a sports fans at all, but I'm really milking the Encyclopedia MOTHER for all it's worth to bring out Ninten's personality.", "kenisu - #27 I tried a different approach to shading this time: up until now, I did all the shading with my Dark Brown colored pencil, regardless of the value of the color I'd be shading. Since that has proven to be a rather ineffective method, I got several suggestions to shade using a darker value of the color I'm shading. Since I don't have that big of a variety of colored pencils, I instead did all the shading on the computer by using the \"darken\" tool. Please feel free to give me your responses on this so that I know whether to continue with it or what."], ["Date", "3/24/10", "3/12/09", "12/9/06", "12/18/06", "1/2/07"], ["Rank", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00", "0.00"]], "pageTitle": "STARMEN.NET - EarthBound / Mother 3 Goodness.", "title": "", "url": "http://starmen.net/vote/vote.php?id=26636&stuffPageNumber=3", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042990112.50/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002310-00275-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 228427178, "recordOffset": 228418976, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "textBeforeTable": "> W T S Q P N M I G F D C B A < Other Submissions by kenisu3000 I hate having to research history.
